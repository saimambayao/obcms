## OBC Management System

### Executive Summary

The OBC Management System is a comprehensive Django-based web application designed to digitize and streamline the operations of the Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (OOBC). This system will enable efficient management of community data, policy recommendations, coordination activities, and program monitoring for Bangsamoro communities residing outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM).

### Project Overview

**Project Name**: OBC Management System  
**Platform**: Django Web Application  
**Target Users**: OOBC staff, BARMM government officials, partner organizations, and authorized stakeholders  
**Project Timeline**: 12-16 months  
**Budget Estimate**: PHP 8-12 million

### Business Context

The OOBC serves as the primary unit within the Office of the Chief Minister responsible for recommending policies and systematic programs to promote the welfare of Bangsamoro communities outside BARMM. Currently operating through manual processes and disparate data sources, the office requires a unified digital platform to enhance operational efficiency, improve data-driven decision-making, and strengthen coordination with multiple stakeholders.

### Problem Statement

The OOBC faces several operational challenges that hinder its effectiveness in serving Other Bangsamoro Communities:

1. **Fragmented Data Management**: Community information is scattered across various documents, spreadsheets, and paper records, making it difficult to generate comprehensive insights.

2. **Manual Coordination Processes**: Coordination with multiple stakeholders relies heavily on emails, phone calls, and physical meetings without systematic tracking.

3. **Limited Monitoring Capabilities**: The absence of a centralized system makes it challenging to track program implementation progress and measure impact effectively.

4. **Inefficient Reporting**: Generating reports for the Chief Minister and other stakeholders requires manual compilation from multiple sources.

5. **Communication Gaps**: Information dissemination to communities lacks a structured digital platform, limiting reach and engagement.

The OBC Management System will provide an integrated platform featuring:

- Comprehensive community database with mapping capabilities
