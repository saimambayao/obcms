## Top 5 Priorities

### 🔴 Priority 1: Async Tasks (4-6 hours) - BEFORE DEPLOYMENT
Add Celery tasks for Communities & Project Central to prevent timeouts.

### 🔴 Priority 2: Monitoring Dashboard (8-10 hours) - WEEK 1
Real-time visibility into AI health, costs, performance.

### 🟡 Priority 3: Error Handling (6-8 hours) - WEEK 2-3
Standardize error handling across all modules.

### 🟡 Priority 4: Prompt Optimization (8-10 hours) - MONTH 1
Reduce token usage by 30-40% → $4-6/month savings.

### 🟢 Priority 5: MANA Standardization (2-3 hours) - OPTIONAL
Use GeminiService consistently across all modules.
