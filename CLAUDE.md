# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## CRITICAL RULE: No Temporary Fixes

**NEVER use temporary fixes, workarounds, or shortcuts when debugging issues.**

When you encounter an error:
- ‚ùå DO NOT remove decorators, comment out code, or bypass validation
- ‚ùå DO NOT use placeholder data or mock implementations
- ‚ùå DO NOT skip proper migrations or database changes
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS identify and fix the root cause
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS implement the proper, complete solution
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS create missing data, migrations, or configurations

**Examples:**

**WRONG (Temporary Fix):**
```python
# Error: Permission 'oobc_management.manage_users' doesn't exist
@login_required
# @require_permission('oobc_management.manage_users')  # Commented out temporarily
def manage_users(request):
    pass
```

**RIGHT (Proper Fix):**
```python
# 1. Create migration to add the missing permission
# 2. Keep decorator in place
@login_required
@require_permission('oobc_management.manage_users')
def manage_users(request):
    pass
```

This rule is MANDATORY and must be followed at all times.

## CRITICAL RULE: No Assumptions - Research When Unsure

**NEVER make assumptions when you are uncertain. ALWAYS research and verify facts.**

When you encounter uncertainty:
- ‚ùå DO NOT assume how code works without checking
- ‚ùå DO NOT guess at solutions based on "likely" behavior
- ‚ùå DO NOT assume issues are caused by common problems (e.g., "probably cache")
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS use parallel agents/tasks to research thoroughly
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS verify facts by reading actual code, documentation, or searching online
- ‚úÖ ALWAYS state explicitly when you don't know something and need to investigate

**Examples:**

**WRONG (Making Assumptions):**
```
"The issue is probably a cache problem. Users need to clear their browser cookies."
# Made assumption without verifying the actual root cause
```

**RIGHT (Research-Based):**
```
"Let me use parallel agents to investigate:
1. Agent 1: Check RBAC permission logic in rbac_service.py
2. Agent 2: Verify view decorators in mana/views.py
3. Agent 3: Examine template permission checks
[After investigation] The issue is X in file Y at line Z."
```

**When to Research Online:**
- Django/Python best practices you're unsure about
- Library-specific behavior (HTMX, Tailwind, etc.)
- Error messages you haven't seen before
- Performance optimization techniques
- Security considerations

**How to Research:**
- Use WebSearch for current documentation, Stack Overflow solutions
- Use WebFetch for official documentation pages
- Use parallel agents for multi-faceted investigations
- Cross-reference multiple sources before concluding

This rule is MANDATORY and must be followed at all times.

## Time Estimates Policy

**NEVER provide time estimates in hours, days, weeks, or months for implementation tasks.**

With powerful AI coding agents, a year's worth of traditional development work can be completed in a single day. Time estimates create false constraints and are obsolete in AI-assisted development.

**This applies to:**

- ‚ùå Conversational responses: "This will take 8 hours"
- ‚ùå Documentation files: "Week 1-2: Implement feature"
- ‚ùå Phase headers: "Phase 1 (Week 1-2)" or "Phase 2 (Days 3-5)"
- ‚ùå Implementation plans: Any timeline labels, week ranges, or date estimates
- ‚ùå Roadmaps: "Q1 2024", "Month 1", "Sprint 1-2"

**Instead, focus on:**

- **Priority**: CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW (all caps in phase headers)
- **Complexity**: Simple, Moderate, or Complex
- **Dependencies**: What must be done before this task (e.g., "Requires dashboard metrics view")
- **Prerequisites**: What needs to exist first (e.g., "Model must exist", "API endpoint required")

**Critical:** This policy applies to ALL documentation files under `docs/`, including implementation plans, feature specifications, and phased rollout plans. Never use week ranges, day counts, hour estimates, or any time-based labels.

## Development Environment

### Setup Requirements
- **Virtual Environment**: Python 3.12 `venv/`
