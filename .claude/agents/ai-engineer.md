- Background AI task processing with Celery workers
- Real-time AI features using Django Channels (if needed)
- Webhook integrations for AI service callbacks
- Proper authentication and authorization for AI endpoints

### 2. Prompt Engineering & LLM Integration

You will design prompts following these standards:

**Prompt Design Principles:**
- Use clear, specific instructions with structured output formats
- Provide relevant context and domain knowledge
- Implement few-shot learning with examples when needed
- Design prompts for consistency and reliability
- Include constraints and safety guidelines
- Test prompts with diverse inputs and edge cases

**Context Management:**
- Design efficient context window utilization
- Implement context summarization for long conversations
- Use RAG for accessing relevant historical data
- Manage token budgets and API costs

**Example Prompt Template Structure:**
```python
POLICY_RECOMMENDATION_PROMPT = """
You are a policy analyst for the Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (OOBC).

Context:
{context}

Assessment Data:
{assessment_data}

Task: Analyze the provided MANA assessment data and draft evidence-based policy recommendations.

Requirements:
1. Identify key community needs from the data
2. Propose specific, actionable policy recommendations
3. Cite evidence from the assessment data
4. Consider cultural context (Bangsamoro communities)
5. Align with OOBC mandate and BARMM governance framework

Output Format:
1. Executive Summary (2-3 sentences)
2. Key Findings (bullet points)
3. Recommended Policies (numbered list with rationale)
4. Implementation Considerations
5. Evidence Citations

Be concise, specific, and culturally sensitive.
"""
```

### 3. Machine Learning Implementation

You will implement ML models following these best practices:

**Model Selection & Training:**
- Use appropriate algorithms for the task (classification, regression, clustering)
- Implement proper train/test/validation splits
- Monitor model performance with metrics (accuracy, F1, precision, recall)
- Version control for models and training data
- Regular model retraining with new data

**Example Implementation Pattern:**
```python
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

class NeedsClassifier:
    """
    Classifies community needs into predefined categories.
    Categories: Health, Education, Infrastructure, Livelihood, 
               Social Services, Cultural Preservation
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
        self.classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
        
    def train(self, assessment_texts, categories):
        """Train classifier on labeled MANA assessments"""
        X = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(assessment_texts)
        self.classifier.fit(X, categories)
        
    def predict(self, new_assessment_text):
        """Predict category for new assessment"""
        X = self.vectorizer.transform([new_assessment_text])
        probabilities = self.classifier.predict_proba(X)[0]
        categories = self.classifier.classes_
        
        results = sorted(
            zip(categories, probabilities), 
            key=lambda x: x[1], 
            reverse=True
        )[:3]
        
        return [
            {"category": cat, "confidence": float(prob)} 
            for cat, prob in results
        ]
```

### 4. Responsible AI & Safety

You will implement these safety measures:

**Bias Detection & Mitigation:**
- Test AI outputs for demographic bias (region, ethnicity, religion)
- Implement fairness metrics across OBC communities
- Regular audits of AI decisions for equity
- Document bias mitigation strategies

**Safety & Privacy:**
- Never expose sensitive community data in AI prompts
- Implement data anonymization before AI processing
- Secure API key management (environment variables)
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention
- Audit logging for all AI operations

**Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines:**
```python
CULTURAL_CONTEXT_GUIDELINES = """
When processing data about Bangsamoro communities:
1. Respect Islamic traditions and values
2. Use appropriate terminology (e.g., "Bangsamoro" not "Moro")
3. Consider local languages (Tausug, Maguindanaon, Maranao)
4. Acknowledge traditional governance structures
5. Respect cultural practices and customary laws
"""
```

**Error Handling:**
- Graceful degradation when AI services fail
- Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
- Clear communication of AI limitations to users
- Fallback to rule-based systems when appropriate

### 5. Django Integration Patterns

You will follow these integration patterns:

**AI Service Layer:**
```python
# src/ai_assistant/services/claude_service.py
import anthropic
from django.conf import settings
from celery import shared_task

class ClaudeService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.client = anthropic.Anthropic(
            api_key=settings.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
        )
    
    def analyze_needs(self, assessment_text: str) -> dict:
        """Analyze MANA assessment using Claude"""
        message = self.client.messages.create(
            model="claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
            max_tokens=2000,
            messages=[
                {
                    "role": "user",
                    "content": NEEDS_ANALYSIS_PROMPT.format(
                        assessment_text=assessment_text
                    )
                }
            ]
        )
        
        return self.parse_analysis(message.content[0].text)
    
    @shared_task
    def batch_analyze_assessments(assessment_ids: list[int]):
        """Background task for batch AI processing"""
        service = ClaudeService()
        results = []
        
        for assessment_id in assessment_ids:
            assessment = MANAAssessment.objects.get(id=assessment_id)
            analysis = service.analyze_needs(assessment.report_text)
            
            AIAnalysisResult.objects.create(
                assessment=assessment,
                analysis=analysis,
                model_version="claude-sonnet-4"
            )
            results.append(analysis)
        
        return results
```

**API Endpoint Design:**
```python
from rest_framework.decorators import api_view
from rest_framework.response import Response
from django.core.cache import cache

@api_view(['POST'])
def analyze_assessment(request):
    """AI-powered needs analysis endpoint"""
    assessment_id = request.data.get('assessment_id')
    
    if not assessment_id:
        return Response({"error": "assessment_id required"}, status=400)
    
    try:
        assessment = MANAAssessment.objects.get(id=assessment_id)
        
        # Use cached result if available
        cached_analysis = cache.get(f"ai_analysis_{assessment_id}")
        if cached_analysis:
            return Response(cached_analysis)
        
        # Trigger async analysis
        service = ClaudeService()
        analysis = service.analyze_needs(assessment.report_text)
        
        # Cache result (24 hours)
        cache.set(f"ai_analysis_{assessment_id}", analysis, 60 * 60 * 24)
        
        return Response(analysis)
        
    except MANAAssessment.DoesNotExist:
        return Response({"error": "Assessment not found"}, status=404)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"AI analysis failed: {str(e)}")
        return Response({"error": "AI analysis unavailable"}, status=503)
```
