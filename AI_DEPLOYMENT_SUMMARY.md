### Infrastructure Setup Commands

**Quick Start (Automated):**
```bash
./scripts/deploy_ai.sh
```

**Manual Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Install Redis
sudo apt-get install redis-server
redis-cli ping  # Verify: PONG

# 2. Start Celery
celery -A obc_management worker -l info &
celery -A obc_management beat -l info &

# 3. Start Gunicorn
gunicorn obc_management.wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 --workers 4
```

---

## Monitoring & Cost Management ✅

### Cost Tracking: Fully Implemented

**Components:**
1. ✅ **AIOperation Model** - Logs every API call with cost, tokens, response time
2. ✅ **CostTracker Service** - Real-time cost accumulation, budget alerts
3. ✅ **Admin Dashboard** - Cost breakdown by module, operation type, date range

**Usage:**
```python
from ai_assistant.utils import CostTracker
tracker = CostTracker()
print(f"Today: ${tracker.get_daily_cost():.2f}")
print(f"Month: ${tracker.get_monthly_cost():.2f}")
```

**Budget Alerts:**
- 75% threshold: Warning
- 90% threshold: Critical
- Configurable daily/monthly budgets

**Expected Costs:**
- Gemini API: $50-100/month (~50K requests)
- Managed Redis: $30/month
- **Total: $80-130/month**

### Logging: Fully Configured

**AI Logs:**
- `src/logs/ai_assistant.log` - All AI operations
- `src/logs/django.log` - General application
- Stdout/stderr for Docker (production)

**Monitoring Metrics:**
- Total operations count
- Success/failure rate
- Cache hit rate (target: 80%+)
- Average response time
- Cost by module/operation type

---

## Deployment Configuration ⚠️

### Required Environment Variables (Action Needed)

**CRITICAL - Must configure before deployment:**
```bash
# 1. Generate SECRET_KEY
python -c "from django.core.management.utils import get_random_secret_key; print(get_random_secret_key())"

# 2. Get Gemini API key
# Visit: https://ai.google.dev/
# Create project, get API key

# 3. Configure .env
cat > .env << EOF
SECRET_KEY=<generated-50-char-key>
DEBUG=0
ALLOWED_HOSTS=yourdomain.com,www.yourdomain.com
CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS=https://yourdomain.com,https://www.yourdomain.com
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/obcms_prod
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-gemini-api-key>
EOF
```

### Configuration Validation

**Before deployment, verify:**
```bash
cd src
python manage.py check --deploy

# Expected: System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
```

**After deployment, verify:**
```bash
./scripts/verify_ai.sh

# Expected: All checks pass
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Automated Deployment (Recommended) ⏱️ 30 min
```bash
# 1. Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy_ai.sh

# 2. Configure .env file
nano .env

# 3. Start services
sudo supervisorctl start all

# 4. Verify
./scripts/verify_ai.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Deployment ⏱️ 4-6 hours
See: `AI_DEPLOYMENT_RUNBOOK.md` for step-by-step instructions

### Option 3: Docker Deployment
See: `docs/deployment/docker-guide.md`

---

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks ✅
```bash
# 1. AI system health
python manage.py ai_health_check

# 2. Redis connectivity
redis-cli ping  # Should return: PONG

# 3. Celery workers
celery -A obc_management inspect active

# 4. Django deployment
python manage.py check --deploy

# 5. Test AI operation
python manage.py shell -c "
from ai_assistant.services import GeminiService
service = GeminiService()
result = service.generate_text('Hello')
print('✓ Working' if result['success'] else '✗ Failed')
"
```

### Smoke Tests ✅
1. Access admin panel: `https://yourdomain.com/admin/`
2. Login with superuser
3. Navigate to: AI Assistant → AI Operations
4. Send test chat message
5. Verify AI response received
6. Check AIOperation record created
7. Verify cost tracking working

---

## Known Limitations & Considerations

### API Rate Limits
- **Gemini Free Tier:** 60 req/min, 1,500 req/day
- **Sufficient for:** Most OBCMS workloads
- **If exceeded:** Implement request queuing or upgrade to paid tier

### Vector Storage
- **Current:** Local FAISS indices (sufficient for <100K documents)
- **Scale limit:** ~100K documents per index
- **If exceeded:** Consider managed vector database (Pinecone, Weaviate)

### Cache Strategy
- **Redis required:** For cost tracking and response caching
- **Cache hit rate target:** 80%+ (reduces API costs)
- **TTL optimization:** 24h for analysis, 7d for static content

---

## Rollback Procedure

**If deployment fails:**
```bash
# 1. Stop all services
sudo supervisorctl stop all

# 2. Revert code
git checkout <previous-commit>

# 3. Restore database (if needed)
./scripts/db_restore.sh /path/to/backup.sql

# 4. Restart services
sudo supervisorctl start all
```
