# Task ID: 23
# Title: Stabilize Planning Dashboards Routing
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19, 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Ensure newly added planning, budgeting, and strategic dashboards are exported through the common.views package so URL inclusion no longer crashes runserver.
# Details:
1. Re-export Phase 2-5 management dashboard views (gap analysis, policy-budget matrix, MAO focal registry, community voting, transparency) via `common.views.__init__`
2. Add strategic planning dashboards (strategic goals, annual planning, regional development alignment) to the exported list
3. Include scenario planning views to keep budgeting routes consistent
4. Verify Django startup succeeds after changes

# Test Strategy:
1. Run `./manage.py check` to confirm import resolution
2. Start `./manage.py runserver` and ensure no AttributeError appears
3. Load `/admin/` and `/oobc-management/gap-analysis/` to confirm the views resolve

# Notes:
- Regression surfaced when new dashboards were added without updating the common views export module
- Documented fix in tasks log so future route additions remember to update exports
