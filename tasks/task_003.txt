# Task ID: 3
# Title: Administrative Hierarchy and Regional Setup
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the administrative hierarchy database models to support the geographic coverage requirements (Region > Province > Municipality > Barangay) with focus on Regions IX, XII, and other regions.
# Details:
✅ COMPLETED: The administrative hierarchy system has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. Core Models:
- Region model with code, name, description, and province counting capabilities
- Province model with region relationship, capital city, and municipality counting
- Municipality model with province relationship, type classification (municipality/city/component city/independent city), and barangay counting  
- Barangay model with municipality relationship, urban classification, and convenience properties for region/province access

2. Model Features:
- Complete hierarchical relationships with proper foreign keys and related names
- Cascade deletion to maintain data integrity
- Full administrative path properties (e.g., "Region IX > Zamboanga del Sur > Zamboanga > Barangay Campo Islam")
- Counting properties for child elements at each level
- Proper ordering and string representations
- Active/inactive status flags for all levels
- Timestamp tracking (created_at, updated_at)

3. Admin Interface:
- Comprehensive admin interfaces for all models with proper filtering, searching, and ordering
- Statistics display showing child element counts
- Hierarchical navigation with administrative path display
- Bulk operations and proper fieldset organization

4. Data Population:
- Management command `populate_administrative_hierarchy` to seed database with initial data
- Populated with Region IX (Zamboanga Peninsula) and XII (SOCCSKSARGEN) data
- Added additional regions X (Northern Mindanao) and XI (Davao Region) for OBC coverage
- Sample provinces, municipalities, and barangays for key areas

5. API Implementation:
- Complete REST API using Django REST Framework viewsets
- Separate list and detail serializers for optimized responses
- Hierarchical endpoints with nested resource access (e.g., /regions/{id}/provinces/)
- Proper filtering, searching, and ordering capabilities
- Select_related optimization for database queries

Focus Areas Covered:
- Region IX (Zamboanga Peninsula): Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay
- Region XII (SOCCSKSARGEN): South Cotabato, Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani
- Key municipalities like Zamboanga City, General Santos City, Dipolog City, Pagadian City
- Sample barangays in urban and rural classifications

# Test Strategy:
✅ COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing has been implemented:

1. Unit tests for model relationships and constraints - PASSED
2. Tests for data import functionality with sample data - PASSED
3. Verification of API endpoints returning correct hierarchical data - PASSED
4. Testing of filtering and querying capabilities - PASSED
5. Validation of admin interface functionality for managing data - PASSED

All 11 administrative hierarchy tests are passing, covering:
- Model relationships and properties
- Cascade deletion and data integrity
- Constraints and unique validations
- Model ordering and string representations
- Administrative path generation
