## Key Features

### Performance Optimization
- **select_related()**: Used on all foreign key relationships
  - `user`, `role`, `permission`, `feature`, `organization`, `parent`, etc.
- **prefetch_related()**: Used for reverse relationships where needed
- **Annotations**: Count queries annotated at queryset level
  - `active_user_count`, `active_perm_count`, `active_role_count`
- **Result**: Fast admin list views even with thousands of records

### User Experience
- **Autocomplete Fields**: For Feature, Permission, Role, Organization
- **Raw ID Fields**: For User model (admin ordering compatibility)
- **Clickable Links**: Count columns link to filtered admin lists
- **format_html()**: Safe HTML rendering in list displays
- **Help Text**: Comprehensive field descriptions
- **Fieldset Groups**: Logical grouping with collapse for metadata

### Security
- **System Role Protection**:
  - Cannot delete system roles (raises ValidationError)
  - Bulk delete action checks and excludes system roles
  - Clear error messages
- **Auto-population**:
  - `created_by` on Role creation
  - `assigned_by` on UserRole creation
  - `granted_by` on UserPermission/RolePermission creation
- **Validation**:
  - clean() methods validate business rules
  - Expiration dates must be in future
  - Organization scoping enforced
  - Circular references prevented

### Admin Actions
1. **RoleAdmin**: "Deactivate selected roles"
   - Excludes system roles from deactivation
   - Updates is_active = False
2. **UserRoleAdmin**: "Activate selected user role assignments"
   - Bulk activate inactive assignments

---

## Technical Decisions

### Autocomplete vs Raw ID Fields
**Challenge**: User model autocomplete caused admin ordering errors
**Solution**: Use `raw_id_fields` for User model references, `autocomplete_fields` for others

**Why?**
- Django admin loads in import order
- RBAC admin imports after User admin registration
- Autocomplete requires admin to be fully registered
- Raw ID fields work without autocomplete registration

**Models affected:**
- `created_by` → raw_id_fields
- `assigned_by` → raw_id_fields
- `granted_by` → raw_id_fields
- `user` → raw_id_fields

**Models using autocomplete:**
- `feature`, `permission`, `role`, `organization`, `parent`, `parent_role` ✓

### Inline Editing
**RolePermissionInline**: Tabular inline for editing role permissions
- Allows adding/removing permissions directly in Role admin
- Autocomplete for permission selection
- Shows: permission, is_granted, conditions, is_active, expires_at
- Extra: 1 blank row for new assignments

### Custom Methods with Links
All count columns link to filtered admin views:
```python
def user_count(self, obj):
    count = obj.user_assignments.filter(is_active=True).count()
    if count > 0:
        url = reverse('admin:common_userrole_changelist')
        return format_html(
            '<a href="{}?role__id__exact={}">{} users</a>',
            url, obj.pk, count
        )
    return '0'
```

**Benefits:**
- One-click navigation to related records
- Pre-filtered lists
- Better admin workflow

## Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing (Admin Interface)

**Feature Admin:**
- [ ] Create new feature
- [ ] Create hierarchical features (parent/child)
- [ ] Filter by category, module
- [ ] Search by name, feature_key
- [ ] Verify sub_feature_count link works
- [ ] Test circular parent prevention

**Permission Admin:**
- [ ] Create permission for feature
- [ ] Filter by permission type, feature category
- [ ] Search by name, codename
- [ ] Verify role_count link works
- [ ] Verify full_permission_key displays correctly

**Role Admin:**
- [ ] Create new role
- [ ] Add permissions via inline
- [ ] Test system role protection (cannot delete)
- [ ] Verify user_count and permission_count links
- [ ] Test "Deactivate roles" action (excludes system roles)
- [ ] Test parent role inheritance

**UserRole Admin:**
- [ ] Assign role to user
- [ ] Set organization context
- [ ] Set expiration date
- [ ] Verify validation (org-scoped roles require org)
- [ ] Test "Activate assignments" action
- [ ] Verify assigned_by auto-population

**UserPermission Admin:**
- [ ] Grant direct permission to user
- [ ] Deny permission (override role)
- [ ] Add reason (required field)
- [ ] Set expiration date
- [ ] Verify granted_by auto-population

### Security Testing

**System Role Protection:**
- [ ] Try to delete system role individually → ValidationError
- [ ] Try bulk delete with system roles → ValidationError + message
- [ ] Verify non-system roles can be deleted

**Auto-population:**
- [ ] Create role → created_by should be current user
- [ ] Assign user role → assigned_by should be current user
- [ ] Grant permission → granted_by should be current user

**Validation:**
- [ ] Expiration date in past → ValidationError
- [ ] Org-scoped role without org → ValidationError
- [ ] System role with org → ValidationError
- [ ] Circular parent role → ValidationError

## Known Issues & Limitations

### User Model Autocomplete
**Issue**: Cannot use autocomplete_fields for User model in RBAC admin
**Reason**: Import ordering - RBAC admin loads after User admin
**Workaround**: Use raw_id_fields for user, created_by, assigned_by, granted_by
**Impact**: Slightly less UX-friendly (shows ID instead of autocomplete), but fully functional

**Future Enhancement**: Move User admin to separate file loaded before RBAC admin

---

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Permission Enforcement (Pending)
- Implement permission checking middleware
- Create @require_permission decorator
- Add template tags for permission checks
- Integrate with views

### Phase 6: Seeding & Fixtures (Pending)
- Create default features (navbar items, modules)
- Create default permissions (view, create, edit, delete, approve)
- Create default roles (OOBC Admin, MOA Admin, etc.)
- Create migration or management command

### Phase 7: Testing (Pending)
- Unit tests for admin classes
- Integration tests for permission enforcement
- Security tests for privilege escalation
- Performance tests for large datasets
