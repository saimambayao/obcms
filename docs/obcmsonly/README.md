# OBCMS Multi-Organizational Documentation

**Status**: ‚úÖ **Cleanup Completed Successfully** (2025-10-20)

**Important**: OBCMS is NOT single-tenant! OOBC coordinates with multiple ministries and organizations.

## ‚úÖ Cleanup Complete

The minimal cleanup has been successfully executed. See [CLEANUP_COMPLETED.md](CLEANUP_COMPLETED.md) for full details.

**What was done**:
- ‚úÖ Removed OCM app (BMMS-specific)
- ‚úÖ Removed BMMS documentation (109 files)
- ‚úÖ Updated comments to OBCMS-centric
- ‚úÖ Updated CLAUDE.md with multi-org architecture
- ‚úÖ Kept organizations, planning, budgeting modules

## üìö Documentation Reference

## Documentation Files

### Recommended Approach ‚úÖ

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[COMPARISON_GUIDE.md](COMPARISON_GUIDE.md)** | ‚≠ê Explains OOBC's multi-org needs and compares cleanup approaches |
| **[MINIMAL_CLEANUP_PLAN.md](MINIMAL_CLEANUP_PLAN.md)** | ‚úÖ Remove OCM + BMMS docs only (30 min, low risk) |

### Alternative Approach ‚ö†Ô∏è

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **[README_BMMS_REMOVAL.md](README_BMMS_REMOVAL.md)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Full removal guide (NOT recommended) |
| **[BMMS_REMOVAL_PLAN.md](BMMS_REMOVAL_PLAN.md)** | ‚ö†Ô∏è 10-phase removal (breaks OOBC operations) |
| **[MANUAL_FILE_UPDATES.md](MANUAL_FILE_UPDATES.md)** | Code templates for full removal |
| **[CLAUDE_MD_UPDATES.md](CLAUDE_MD_UPDATES.md)** | CLAUDE.md updates |

## Why Multi-Organizational?

OOBC works with:
- Ministry of Health (health assessments)
- Ministry of Education (education programs)
- Ministry of Social Services (livelihood programs)
- Partner NGOs (community development)
- Local government units (coordination)

Each needs:
- Isolated data access (security)
- Role-based permissions (RBAC)
- Collaboration capabilities (coordination)

## Quick Decision Matrix

**Choose Minimal Cleanup if:**
- [x] OOBC partners with other ministries ‚úÖ
- [x] OOBC needs strategic planning ‚úÖ
- [x] OOBC needs budget management ‚úÖ
- [x] Data should be isolated by organization ‚úÖ

**Choose Full Removal if:**
- [ ] OOBC works completely alone (unlikely)
- [ ] No strategic planning needed (why not?)
- [ ] No budget management needed (required)
- [ ] All users can see all data (security risk)

**Recommendation**: Use Minimal Cleanup

## Minimal Cleanup (30 minutes)

### What's Removed
- OCM app (BMMS-specific aggregation)
- BMMS documentation (109 files)
- BMMS-centric comments

### What's Kept
- Organizations app (multi-org support)
- Planning module (strategic planning)
- Budget modules (financial management)
- RBAC infrastructure (permissions)
- Data isolation (security)

### Quick Steps

```bash
# 1. Remove OCM
rm -rf src/ocm/

# 2. Remove BMMS docs
rm -rf docs/plans/bmms/

# 3. Update settings.py
# Remove "ocm" from LOCAL_APPS
# Update comments to OBCMS-centric

# 4. Update urls.py
# Remove OCM URL route

# 5. Test
cd src && python manage.py runserver
```

See [MINIMAL_CLEANUP_PLAN.md](MINIMAL_CLEANUP_PLAN.md) for details.

## Full Removal (1-2 hours, NOT recommended)

**Warning**: Removes planning, budgeting, and multi-org support.

See [README_BMMS_REMOVAL.md](README_BMMS_REMOVAL.md) if you're certain this is needed.

## Questions?
