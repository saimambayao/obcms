### 5.6 Line Items and Allocations

#### Understanding Budget Allocation

**Allocation**: The distribution of your total budget across different categories and line items.

**Best Practices:**

1. **Balance**: Avoid over-concentration in one category
2. **Alignment**: Ensure allocations support strategic objectives
3. **Realism**: Base amounts on historical data and actual needs
4. **Flexibility**: Include contingency (5-10% of total) for unexpected costs

#### Recommended Allocation Ratios

While not mandatory, these ratios align with BARMM standards:

- **Personnel Services**: 40-60% of total budget
- **MOOE**: 20-30%
- **Capital Outlay**: 10-20%
- **Programs and Projects**: 10-25%
- **Training and Development**: 2-5%
- **Travel**: 2-5%

[Screenshot: Budget allocation chart showing recommended vs. actual]

#### Adjusting Allocations

If your budget is unbalanced:

1. Review line items in over-allocated categories
2. Identify areas for reduction:
   - Can expenses be shared with other departments?
   - Are there one-time costs that can be deferred?
   - Can services be bundled for cost savings?
3. Edit line item amounts to rebalance
4. Summary panel updates automatically

#### Budget Ceiling Compliance

Each MOA has a **budget ceiling** (maximum allowable budget) set by BARMM:

- Displayed at top of budget form: "MOA Budget Ceiling: PHP XX,XXX,XXX"
- If total exceeds ceiling, red warning appears: "Budget exceeds ceiling by PHP X,XXX,XXX"
- **Cannot submit** until total is at or below ceiling
- Contact Budget Office to request ceiling increase (requires justification)
