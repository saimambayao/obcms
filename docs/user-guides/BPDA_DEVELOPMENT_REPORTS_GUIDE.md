## BDP Alignment Scoring

### What is BDP Alignment?

BDP Alignment measures how well a PPA contributes to the strategic goals outlined in the Bangsamoro Development Plan. The system assigns an alignment score (0-100%) based on multiple factors.

### Alignment Scoring Methodology

**Scoring Components:**

| Component | Weight | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| **Strategic Goal Match** | 40% | Does PPA directly address a BDP strategic goal? |
| **Outcome Indicator Coverage** | 30% | How many BDP outcome indicators does it track? |
| **Geographic Priority** | 15% | Does it target high-priority OBC regions? |
| **Beneficiary Reach** | 15% | How many OBCs does it benefit? |

**Scoring Scale:**
- **90-100%**: Excellent alignment (critical BDP intervention)
- **75-89%**: Strong alignment (directly supports BDP goals)
- **60-74%**: Moderate alignment (partially supports BDP)
- **40-59%**: Weak alignment (tangential BDP contribution)
- **0-39%**: Minimal alignment (not BDP-aligned)
