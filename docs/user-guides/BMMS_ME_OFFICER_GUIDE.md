- ☐ Not Yet Started
- ☐ Cancelled

If behind schedule or cancelled, explain reason:
```
Example: "Training delayed by 2 weeks due to venue unavailability.
Original venue flooded due to heavy rains. Alternative venue
secured for rescheduled date (March 15, 2025)."
```

---

**2. Quality Assessment**

Rate quality aspects (1-5 scale):
- **Relevance:** Does activity meet beneficiary needs? (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)
- **Efficiency:** Are resources used optimally? (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)
- **Effectiveness:** Is activity achieving intended results? (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)
- **Sustainability:** Will benefits last beyond project? (1=Poor, 5=Excellent)

Provide narrative for each rating:
```
Example:
Relevance (5): Training content highly relevant. Teachers expressed
strong appreciation for culturally-appropriate literacy methods.

Efficiency (4): Training conducted on budget. Venue costs 10% below
estimate. Trainer fees as planned. Some inefficiency in material
distribution (15-minute delay).

Effectiveness (4): Participants demonstrated mastery of key concepts
in practical exercises. 90% pass rate on post-training assessment.
10% need additional coaching.

Sustainability (5): Cascade training model ensures trained teachers
will train peers. Training materials remain with schools. Ministry
committed to ongoing support.

Result: t(148) = 5.32, p < 0.001
Interpretation: Difference is statistically significant
```

---

**Step 3:** Qualitative Analysis

**Coding Qualitative Data:**
- Transcribe interviews and FGDs
- Read transcripts multiple times
- Identify themes and patterns
- Code data systematically

**Example Themes:**
```
QUALITATIVE THEMES FROM TEACHER INTERVIEWS
===========================================

Theme 1: Culturally-Relevant Content Appreciated
"The training finally gave us methods that work with our Bangsamoro
students. Before, we used methods designed for urban areas that
didn't fit our context." (Teacher, Rural School)

Theme 2: Need for Ongoing Support
"The training was great, but we need follow-up. I have questions
as I implement, and it would help to have someone to consult."
(Teacher, 3 years experience)

Theme 3: Material Availability Critical
"I want to use all the methods I learned, but without the materials,
it's difficult. We need more books and visual aids." (Teacher, Remote
School)

Theme 4: Peer Learning Valuable
"The best part was learning from other teachers. We shared our
challenges and solutions. We formed a group chat to continue
supporting each other." (Teacher, Urban School)
```

**Step 4:** Triangulation

Compare findings across methods:
- Do surveys, interviews, FGDs, observations agree?
- Where are contradictions? Why?
- What is the weight of evidence?

**Example Triangulation:**
```
Evaluation Question: Are trained teachers applying new methods?

Survey Finding: 65% report full application
Interview Finding: Teachers describe challenges limiting application
Observation Finding: 50% observed using new methods effectively
FGD Finding (Students): Some students report new activities, others
see little change

Triangulated Conclusion: Teachers are attempting to apply training,
but effectiveness varies. Support gaps and resource constraints limit
full implementation. Need: coaching, materials, peer learning.
```

✅ "95% of surveyed teachers rated overall satisfaction 4 or 5 out of 5."

**Be Specific:**
❌ "Some challenges were identified."
✅ "45% of teachers reported lack of materials as a barrier to application."

**Be Balanced:**
- Present both positive and negative findings
- Acknowledge limitations
- Avoid bias

**Use Visuals:**
- Charts for quantitative data
- Word clouds for common themes
- Photos for documentation
- Maps for geographic patterns

[SCREENSHOT: Report with embedded charts]

**Step 3:** Formulate Recommendations

**SMART Recommendations:**
- **Specific:** Clear action
- **Measurable:** Can track implementation
- **Achievable:** Realistic given resources
- **Relevant:** Address identified issues
- **Time-bound:** Deadline specified

**Example Recommendations:**

**Recommendation 1 (Immediate):**
```
Establish teacher peer learning groups in each province to provide
ongoing support and problem-solving.

Rationale: Teachers value peer learning (identified as key success
factor), and ongoing support gaps limit application.

Actions:
- Identify lead teachers in each province
- Train leads on facilitation
- Provide WhatsApp/Telegram group setup support
- Schedule monthly virtual meetings

Responsibility: Training Coordinator
Timeline: Within 1 month
Budget: PHP 50,000 (facilitator training, communication allowances)
```

**Recommendation 2 (Short-Term):**
```
Conduct follow-up coaching visits to trained teachers within 3 months
of training to address implementation challenges.

Rationale: Teachers express need for just-in-time support as they
apply methods in classrooms.

Actions:
- Train master trainers as coaches
- Schedule school visits (2 visits per teacher)
- Provide on-site mentoring and feedback
- Document common challenges for training revisions

Responsibility: M&E Officer (coordination), Master Trainers (coaching)
Timeline: Months 2-4 after training
Budget: PHP 200,000 (transportation, coach allowances)
```

**Recommendation 3 (Long-Term):**
```
Develop and distribute complete teaching-learning material packages
to all trained teachers to enable full implementation of methods.

Rationale: 45% of teachers cite material shortages as major barrier.
Observation data confirms limited availability.

Actions:
- Conduct needs assessment for materials
- Develop/procure materials (books, flashcards, posters)
- Distribute to all 500 trained teachers
- Include digital versions for future scalability

Responsibility: Budget Officer (procurement), Planning Officer
(coordination)
Timeline: Within 6 months
Budget: PHP 2,000,000 (materials for 500 teachers)
```

**Step 4:** Stakeholder Validation

### 10.2 Data Management Issues

**Issue: Duplicate Entries**

**Identification:**
- Same respondent, same timestamp
- Identical or very similar responses

**Resolution:**
1. Identify duplicates
   - Use duplicate detection tool
   - Review flagged entries
2. Determine correct entry
   - Check timestamps
   - Verify with data collector
3. Mark duplicates
   - Flag as "Duplicate - Do Not Analyze"
   - Retain for audit but exclude from analysis
4. Prevent future duplicates
   - Enable "One Response Per Respondent" setting
   - Train data collectors

---

**Issue: Data Entry Errors**

**Identification:**
- Validation flags
- Manual review finds errors
- Outlier detection

**Resolution:**
1. Categorize error type
   - Typo (e.g., 1000 instead of 100)
   - Wrong field (data in wrong column)
   - Wrong code (selected wrong option)
2. Correct if possible
   - If obvious error, correct
   - Document correction
3. Contact data collector if unclear
   - Request verification
   - Obtain correct value
4. Flag as "Unable to Verify" if unresolvable
   - Exclude from analysis
   - Document in report limitations

## Appendix A: M&E Frameworks Quick Reference

**Logic Model:**
```
Inputs → Activities → Outputs → Outcomes → Impact

Example:
Budget, Staff → Training → Teachers Trained → Teaching Improved → Literacy Increased
```

**Results Chain:**
```
Similar to Logic Model, emphasizes causality
```

**Theory of Change:**
```
Long-term goal ← Outcomes ← Outputs ← Activities
Includes assumptions and external factors
```

**OECD-DAC Criteria:**
- Relevance: Does intervention address needs?
- Effectiveness: Are objectives achieved?
- Efficiency: Are resources used optimally?
- Impact: What are broader effects?
- Sustainability: Will benefits last?
