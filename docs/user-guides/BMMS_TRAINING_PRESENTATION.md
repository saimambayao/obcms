**Speaker Notes:**
"BMMS navigation is intuitive. The top menu is always there - click Budget, and you jump to budgets. See these breadcrumbs? They're like a trail of breadcrumbs in a forest, showing where you are. The search bar is powerful - press Ctrl+K anywhere and type what you're looking for. The bell icon shows notifications - if it has a red number, you have unread alerts. Your profile avatar on the right gives access to settings."

---

### Slide 14: Understanding User Roles
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Your Role in BMMS

**Key Talking Points:**
- **MOA Staff**: Create and edit draft items (plans, budgets, activities)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Not everyone has the same permissions, and that's by design. If you're a staff member, you can create strategic plans, but a manager needs to approve them. If you're a manager, you can approve budgets up to a certain amount, but executives approve larger budgets. This ensures proper oversight and compliance. To check your role, click your profile avatar and select Profile Settings. Your role is shown at the top."

---

### Slide 15: Profile Setup

Upload a profile photo if you have one handy - it helps in a multi-ministry system where people might not know each other. This information appears whenever you create or approve something, so accuracy matters for accountability."

**Hands-On Exercise:**
"**Exercise 1.2: Complete Your Profile** (15 minutes)
1. Click profile avatar > Profile Settings
2. Fill in all required fields:
   - Full name
   - Position/title

**Speaker Notes:**
"You don't want to miss important updates, but you also don't want notification overload. Let's find your balance. Go to Profile Settings > Notifications tab. [Demo on screen]. I recommend enabling both email and browser notifications initially. You can always dial it back if it's too much. Email digest is good if you prefer one summary at 8 AM instead of individual emails throughout the day. Do Not Disturb prevents notifications during off-hours."

  1. "Total Budget Allocated: PHP 25,000,000" (green gradient)
  2. "Active Programs: 12" (blue gradient)
  3. "Partnerships: 5" (purple gradient)
  4. "Completion Rate: 78%" (teal gradient with progress bar)
- Arrows showing card is clickable
- Customization menu screenshot

**Speaker Notes:**
"These stat cards are your quick health check. Right now, they're mostly zeros because we're in training. But imagine seeing 'Total Budget: PHP 25 million, 78% utilized' at a glance. Green means you're on track. Orange means attention needed - maybe a deadline approaching. Red is critical - something requires immediate action. Click any card to drill down into details. You can customize which cards show - we'll cover that later."

- BARMM development pillars shown as 5 connected circles
- Timeline showing 3-5 year span
- Example plan title: "MSWDO Strategic Plan 2024-2028"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Strategic planning is where everything starts. This module helps you move from 'we should do more outreach' to 'we will increase IP services coverage from 25% to 65% by 2028 through these specific actions.' It's based on the OKR methodology - Objectives and Key Results - used by leading organizations worldwide. But we've adapted it for BARMM's context and government workflows."

**Speaker Notes:**
"Think of a strategic plan like a tree. The plan is the trunk, objectives are major branches, key results are smaller branches. An example: Your plan is 'MSWDO 2024-2028.' An objective might be 'Expand IP services coverage.' Key results under that objective are specific deliverables: 'Establish 10 new social service centers,' 'Train 50 social workers,' 'Register 2,000 new beneficiaries.' Each key result is measurable and time-bound."

### Slide 24: Setting Objectives
**Complexity:** Complex

**Title:** Defining Strategic Objectives

**Key Talking Points:**
- Objectives are **what** you want to achieve (not **how**)
- Good objectives are: Specific, Measurable, Time-bound, Aligned with mandate
- Bad objective example: "Improve healthcare" (too vague)
- Good objective example: "Increase primary healthcare access in rural areas by 40% by 2028"
- Add 3-5 objectives per strategic plan (don't overload)

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Side-by-side comparison: Bad Objective vs. Good Objective
- Characteristics checklist for good objectives (SMART framework adapted for government)
- Example objectives from each pilot ministry:
  - MOH: "Reduce maternal mortality rate by 50% in target provinces"
  - MOLE: "Create 10,000 employment opportunities for Bangsamoro youth"
  - MAFAR: "Increase agricultural productivity by 30% through modern farming techniques"
- Traffic light: Red (bad objective), Green (good objective)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Objectives are the 'what' of your plan. They answer: What major change do we want to see by the end of this plan period? Let's look at examples. [Show bad example]: 'Improve healthcare.' What does that mean? How do you measure it? When is it achieved? Too vague. [Show good example]: 'Reduce maternal mortality rate by 50% in Provinces X, Y, Z by December 2028.' That's specific, measurable, and time-bound. You can track progress and know when you've succeeded."

1. Open your strategic plan (Planning module → Plans list → Click plan name)
2. Click "Edit Plan" button (top-right)
3. Scroll to "Objectives" section
4. Click "Add Objective" button
5. Add Objective 1:
   - **Title**: [Major goal relevant to your ministry]
   - **Description**: 150-300 characters explaining the objective
   - **Target Metric**: What you'll measure (e.g., "Number of beneficiaries served")
   - **Baseline Value**: Current state (e.g., "1,250 beneficiaries")
   - **Target Value**: Desired state (e.g., "5,000 beneficiaries")
   - **Target Date**: End of plan period (December 31, 2028)
   - **Priority Level**: Critical, High, Medium, or Low
   - **Responsible Officer**: Select yourself or colleague

Trainers: This is the most complex exercise so far. Expect it to take full 25 minutes. Help with:
- Crafting good objective titles (specific, measurable)
- Choosing appropriate metrics
- Setting realistic baseline and target values
- Ensure objectives are diverse, not repetitive
- Verify all required fields completed before saving

Ministry-specific guidance:
- **MOH**: Focus on health outcomes (mortality rates, coverage, disease prevention)
- **MOLE**: Focus on employment metrics (jobs created, training programs, labor compliance)
- **MAFAR**: Focus on agricultural productivity (yield increases, farmer incomes, modern techniques adoption)"

### Slide 26: Defining Key Results
**Complexity:** Complex

**Title:** Breaking Down Objectives: Key Results

**Key Talking Points:**
- Key Results are **how** you achieve objectives (the specific deliverables)
- Each objective should have 2-5 key results
- Key results must be: Specific, Measurable, Time-bound, Achievable
- Example objective: "Expand maternal healthcare coverage"
- Example key results:
  1. "Establish 15 new rural health units by June 2026"
  2. "Train 100 midwives on emergency obstetric care by December 2025"
  3. "Distribute 10,000 maternal health kits in target areas by December 2027"

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Objective at top with 3-4 key results branching below
- Each key result shown as a card with checkboxes:
  - ☑ Specific
  - ☑ Measurable
  - ☑ Time-bound
  - ☑ Achievable
- Progress bars showing completion status
- Color coding: Not Started (gray), In Progress (blue), Completed (green), At Risk (orange)

**Speaker Notes:**
"If objectives are the destination, key results are the milestones along the way. Let's take our maternal healthcare objective. How do we achieve it? First, we need infrastructure - 'Establish 15 rural health units.' Second, we need skilled staff - 'Train 100 midwives.' Third, we need supplies - 'Distribute 10,000 health kits.' Each key result is concrete, measurable, and has a deadline. When all key results are achieved, the objective is achieved."

---

### Slide 27: Adding Key Results (Demo)
**Complexity:** Complex

**Title:** Live Demo: Adding Key Results

**Key Talking Points:**
- Within an objective, click "Add Key Result"
- Fill in: Title, description, success metric, target value, current value, due date, assigned to
- Success metric: What you're counting (e.g., "Number of health units established")
- Current value starts at 0, updates as you track progress
- Due date should be before objective target date
- Assign to specific person accountable for delivery
- Save key result - it appears under objective

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Screen recording showing:
  1. Clicking "Add Key Result" within an objective
  2. Filling out key result form (all fields)
  3. Saving key result
  4. Key result appearing in nested list under objective
- Form with sample data filled in
- Arrows and highlights showing field relationships

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let's add key results to your first objective. In edit mode, find your first objective. Click 'Add Key Result' button under it. [Live demo]. Key result title: 'Establish 15 rural health units in Provinces X, Y, Z.' Description: 'Construct and equip fully functional RHUs providing maternal healthcare services.' Success metric: 'Number of RHUs operational.' Target value: '15'. Current value: '0' (we're starting from scratch). Due date: June 30, 2026 (midpoint of plan). Assigned to: [Select project manager]. Click checkmark. See how it nests under the objective? Add 2-3 more key results for this objective."

**Hands-On Exercise:**
"**Exercise 2.3: Add Key Results to Objectives** (30 minutes)
1. Continue editing your strategic plan
2. For each of your 3 objectives, add 2-3 key results
3. **Objective 1**: Add 3 key results
   - Key Result 1.1:
     - **Title**: Specific deliverable with number and deadline
     - **Description**: How this contributes to objective
     - **Success Metric**: What you're measuring
     - **Target Value**: Quantifiable goal (number)
     - **Current Value**: 0 (starting point)
     - **Due Date**: Before objective target date
     - **Assigned To**: Responsible person
   - Key Result 1.2: [Repeat for 2nd key result]
   - Key Result 1.3: [Repeat for 3rd key result]
4. **Objective 2**: Add 2-3 key results (same process)
5. **Objective 3**: Add 2-3 key results (same process)
6. **Total**: 6-9 key results across 3 objectives
7. Ensure key results are diverse (not repetitive)
8. Stagger due dates throughout plan period
9. Click "Save Draft" when all key results added
10. Review your complete plan structure (objectives + key results)
11. Raise your hand when complete

Trainers: This is the longest exercise. Allow full 30 minutes. Trainees may struggle with:
- Differentiating key results from objectives (KRs are more specific and actionable)
- Setting realistic target values (help with context)
- Staggering due dates logically (early KRs should feed into later ones)

Circulate actively. Check each trainee's plan has coherent structure:
- 3 objectives
- 2-3 key results per objective
- Key results are specific and measurable
- Logical progression of activities

Use ministry examples to guide:
- **MOH**: Infrastructure (RHUs), Training (midwives), Outreach (health camps), Supplies (kits)
- **MOLE**: Job creation programs, Skills training, Labor compliance initiatives, Youth employment
- **MAFAR**: Irrigation systems, Farmer training, Seed distribution, Market linkages"

---

### Slide 28: Tracking Progress
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Keeping Plans Alive: Progress Tracking

**Key Talking Points:**
- Strategic plans aren't static documents - track progress regularly
- Update key result progress: Current value, notes, supporting documents
- Status auto-calculates: On Track (green), At Risk (yellow), Behind Schedule (red), Completed (blue)
- Progress updates create audit trail and historical record
- Recommended frequency: Monthly updates for active key results

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Before/After screenshots:
  - Before: Key result showing 0% complete
  - After: Same key result showing 60% complete with progress bar
- Progress update form screenshot
- Timeline showing multiple progress updates over time
- Status indicators with color legend

**Speaker Notes:**
"A strategic plan sitting on a shelf helps no one. BMMS makes progress tracking easy. When you complete a milestone - say, you've established 7 of your 15 health units - update the key result. Click 'Update Progress,' enter current value '7,' add notes about what was accomplished, upload photos or reports as evidence. The system calculates percentage: 7 of 15 = 47% complete. Status might show 'At Risk' if you're behind schedule, or 'On Track' if you're ahead. This real-time tracking enables course correction and keeps everyone accountable."

---

### Slide 29: Approval Workflow
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Submitting Plans for Approval

**Key Talking Points:**
- Draft plans are editable, not yet official
- When plan is complete, submit for approval
- Approval workflow: Staff creates → Manager reviews → Executive approves
- Approvers can: Approve, Return for revision, or Reject
- Once approved, plan status changes to "Active"
- Active plans can still be amended (requires approval process)

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Workflow diagram showing approval chain:
  - Draft (gray) → Submitted (yellow) → Under Review (blue) → Approved (green)
  - OR → Returned for Revision (orange) → [back to Draft]
  - OR → Rejected (red)
- Status badges shown for each stage
- Screenshot of submission confirmation dialog
- Approver notification email example

**Speaker Notes:**
"You don't want to work on a plan for weeks only to have it rejected. That's why BMMS has structured approval. When your plan is ready, click 'Submit for Approval.' Choose your approver - usually your department head or ministry executive. They receive a notification and can review in BMMS. They might approve it immediately, or return it with feedback like 'Add more detail to Objective 2.' If returned, you make changes and resubmit. Once approved, the plan becomes official and active. You can track progress against approved plans."

---

### Slide 30: Strategic Planning Best Practices
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Tips for Effective Strategic Planning

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Start simple**: Better to have 3 excellent objectives than 10 mediocre ones
- **Be realistic**: Set challenging but achievable targets based on resources
- **Involve stakeholders**: Get input from staff who'll implement the plan
- **Review regularly**: Monthly check-ins keep plans on track
- **Document assumptions**: Note what you're assuming (e.g., "Assuming budget approval")
- **Align with BARMM goals**: Ensure your objectives support regional development

**Visual Suggestions:**
- 6 best practice cards with icons:
  1. Quality over quantity (3 stars)
  2. Realistic targets (balance scale)
  3. Stakeholder involvement (people collaborating)
  4. Regular reviews (calendar with checkmarks)
  5. Document assumptions (notepad)
  6. BARMM alignment (BARMM logo)
- Do's and Don'ts comparison table
- Quote from successful pilot ministry (testimonial)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Before we break for lunch, here are hard-won lessons from organizations that do strategic planning well. First, resist the urge to create 20 objectives. Three excellent objectives with clear key results beat ten vague ones every time. Second, be realistic. If you've historically served 1,000 beneficiaries per year, targeting 50,000 next year isn't realistic - maybe 2,000 is. Third, don't plan in isolation. The best strategic plans come from collaborative processes where frontline staff who do the work have input. Finally, review monthly. It takes 15 minutes to update progress, but it keeps your plan living and relevant."

**[LUNCH BREAK: 60 minutes]**

## SECTION 4: BUDGET PLANNING MODULE (Slides 31-40)

### Slide 31: Budget Planning Module Overview
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Module 2: Budget Planning & Bill No. 325 Compliance

**Key Talking Points:**
- Purpose: Prepare, submit, and manage annual budget proposals
- **Parliament Bill No. 325**: Mandates transparent and accountable budgeting across BARMM
- BMMS ensures compliance automatically through enforced fields and workflows
- Key features: Create proposals, add line items, track expenditures, generate quarterly reports
- Multi-level approval process based on budget amount

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Module icon (peso sign with document)
- Parliament Bill No. 325 badge/seal prominently displayed
- Workflow diagram: Create Proposal → Add Line Items → Submit → Approval Chain → Track Expenditures → Quarterly Reporting
- Bill No. 325 requirements checklist with checkmarks
- Sample budget document preview

**Speaker Notes:**
"Welcome back from lunch! This afternoon, we focus on budgeting. For government, the budget isn't just numbers - it's accountability to the people. Parliament Bill No. 325 sets strict requirements for transparency: detailed justifications, standardized categories, quarterly reporting, and full audit trails. BMMS makes compliance easy by guiding you through required fields and automatically generating compliant reports. If you can't submit a budget in BMMS, it means it doesn't meet Bill No. 325 requirements - the system won't let you."

---

### Slide 32: Understanding Bill No. 325
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Parliament Bill No. 325: What You Need to Know

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Mandate**: All BARMM MOAs must follow standardized budgeting practices
- **Key requirements**:
  1. Standardized budget categories (Personnel, MOOE, Capital Outlay, Programs, Training, Travel, Communications, Professional Services)
  2. Line-item justifications required (why this expense is necessary)
  3. Approval thresholds based on amount
  4. Quarterly expenditure reporting
  5. Full audit trail of all changes
- **Consequences of non-compliance**: Budget suspension, delayed approvals
- **BMMS role**: Enforces compliance through system design

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Bill No. 325 key requirements shown as 5 numbered pillars
- Compliance checklist with green checkmarks
- Sample non-compliant vs. compliant budget comparison (side-by-side)
- BMMS "Compliance Check" feature screenshot showing green checkmark
- Warning icon showing "Cannot submit until compliant"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Bill No. 325 passed in [year] after concerns about budget transparency. It requires all MOAs to use the same categories, explain every peso spent, and report quarterly. Before BMMS, MOAs submitted budgets in different formats - some in Excel, some in Word, some handwritten. Comparing across MOAs was impossible. Now, everyone uses BMMS with standardized fields. The beauty is, if you follow the system prompts, you're automatically compliant. BMMS won't let you submit a non-compliant budget - required fields won't let you skip them."

---

### Slide 33: Budget Structure & Categories
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Budget Categories (Bill No. 325 Standard)

**Key Talking Points:**
- **8 standardized categories** (all MOAs use these):
  1. **Personnel Services**: Salaries, benefits, allowances
  2. **MOOE (Maintenance and Other Operating Expenses)**: Utilities, supplies, maintenance
  3. **Capital Outlay**: Equipment, infrastructure, vehicles
  4. **Programs and Projects**: Direct service delivery costs
  5. **Training and Development**: Staff capacity building
  6. **Travel**: Official travel expenses
  7. **Communications**: Internet, phone, postage
  8. **Professional Services**: Consultants, contractors
- Each category has subcategories for detailed tracking
- Your budget must have at least one line item in Personnel and MOOE (required)

**Visual Suggestions:**
- 8 category cards arranged in a grid (2 rows x 4 columns)
- Each card: Icon, category name, brief definition, percentage allocation guideline
- Pie chart showing typical allocation percentages:
  - Personnel: 40-60%
  - MOOE: 20-30%
  - Capital Outlay: 10-20%
  - Programs: 10-25%
  - Training: 2-5%
  - Travel: 2-5%
  - Communications: 1-3%
  - Professional Services: 2-10%
- Color-coded for easy recognition

**Speaker Notes:**
"These eight categories are the foundation of Bill No. 325. Every peso your ministry spends falls into one of these buckets. Let's understand each. Personnel Services is salaries and benefits - typically your largest expense at 40-60% of total budget. MOOE is day-to-day operations - utilities, office supplies, vehicle fuel. Capital Outlay is big purchases - computers, vehicles, buildings. Programs and Projects is service delivery - the actual work you do for beneficiaries. The other four are self-explanatory. Each category has subcategories for granularity. When creating a budget, you'll select category, then subcategory, for each line item."

"Let's create a budget proposal. Go to Budget module - click Budget in top menu. Click 'Create Budget Proposal.' [Live demo]. Fiscal year: Select '2026' (we're planning for next year). Proposal name: 'MOH Annual Operating Budget FY 2026.' Budget type: 'Annual Operating Budget' - this is your main yearly budget. Description: 'This budget supports MOH's operational expenses and program implementation for fiscal year 2026, aligned with Healthcare Access Plan 2025-2028.' Strategic alignment: Select your strategic plan from dropdown - this links budget to strategy. Prepared by: Auto-filled with your name. Department: Select 'All Departments' if ministry-wide, or specific department. Click 'Save as Draft.'"

**Hands-On Exercise:**
"**Exercise 3.1: Create a Budget Proposal** (15 minutes)
1. Navigate to Budget module (click Budget in top menu)
2. Click "Create Budget Proposal" button
3. Fill in proposal information:
   - **Fiscal Year**: 2026
   - **Proposal Name**: "[Ministry] Annual Operating Budget FY 2026"
     - MOH example: "MOH Annual Operating Budget FY 2026"
     - MOLE example: "MOLE Annual Operating Budget FY 2026"
     - MAFAR example: "MAFAR Annual Operating Budget FY 2026"
   - **Budget Type**: Annual Operating Budget

5. Confirmation message: "Budget proposal saved successfully"
6. You'll see your budget in the Budget Proposals list
7. Raise your hand when complete

Trainers: Ensure everyone can successfully save the budget header before moving to line items. Common issues:
- Description too short (minimum 200 characters)
- Forgetting to select strategic plan
- Wrong fiscal year selected

Verify each trainee's budget proposal saved properly. This foundation is critical for next exercises."

---

### Slide 35: Adding Line Items
**Complexity:** Complex

**Title:** Budget Line Items: The Details Matter

**Key Talking Points:**
- Line items are individual expense entries within budget
- Each line item requires: Category, subcategory, description, amount, justification, funding source, payment schedule
- **Minimum 5 line items required** (Bill No. 325 requirement)
- **Description**: What specifically will be purchased/paid (100-500 characters)
- **Justification**: Why this expense is necessary and how it supports strategic objectives (100-300 characters)
- **Amount**: In Philippine Pesos (PHP), system auto-formats with commas
- Funding source: BARMM General Fund, National Allocation, Special Purpose Fund, External Grant, Other

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Screenshot of line item form with all fields visible
- Example completed line item:
  - Category: Personnel Services
  - Subcategory: Salaries
  - Description: "Salaries for 25 social workers assigned to IP outreach programs, including COLA per CSC guidelines"
  - Amount: PHP 5,000,000.00
  - Justification: "Social workers essential for implementing Strategic Plan Objective 1: Expand IP services coverage"
  - Funding Source: BARMM General Fund
  - Payment Schedule: Monthly
- Required field indicators (red asterisks)
- Budget summary panel showing real-time total

**Speaker Notes:**
"Line items are where Bill No. 325 transparency happens. You can't just say 'PHP 5 million for salaries.' You must specify: Salaries for which positions? How many? Why are they necessary? How do they support your strategic objectives? Let's look at a good example. [Show on screen]. This line item says 'Salaries for 25 social workers assigned to IP outreach programs.' It specifies the number (25), the positions (social workers), and the program (IP outreach). The justification ties it to the strategic plan: 'Essential for Strategic Plan Objective 1.' That's transparency."

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let's add line items to your budget. Open your budget proposal from the list - click its name. Click 'Edit Proposal' button. Scroll down to 'Line Items' section. Click 'Add Line Item.' [Live demo]. Category: Select 'Personnel Services.' Subcategory automatically populates - select 'Salaries.' Description: 'Salaries for 10 registered nurses staffing new rural health units.' Amount: Type '3000000' (3 million). System formats it as 'PHP 3,000,000.00' - see? Justification: 'Nurses required to staff RHUs established under Strategic Plan Key Result 1.1.' Funding source: 'BARMM General Fund.' Payment schedule: 'Monthly.' Click checkmark. Watch the budget summary on the right - total updates to PHP 3,000,000. Let's add another line item."

**Hands-On Exercise:**
"**Exercise 3.2: Add Budget Line Items** (40 minutes)
1. Open your budget proposal (Budget module → Proposals list → Click proposal name)
2. Click "Edit Proposal" button
3. Scroll to "Line Items" section
4. Click "Add Line Item" button
5. Add at least **5 diverse line items** covering multiple categories:

- Click checkmark to save

6. After adding 5 line items, check Budget Summary panel (right side):
   - Total budget amount should display
   - Compliance check should show green checkmark
   - Breakdown by category pie chart should show distribution
7. Add 2-3 more line items if time permits (recommended: 7-10 total)
8. Click "Save as Draft" at bottom of form
9. Review your complete budget proposal
10. Raise your hand when you have minimum 5 line items saved

Trainers: This is a critical and time-intensive exercise. Allow full 40 minutes. Trainees often struggle with:
- Writing specific descriptions (not vague)
- Crafting meaningful justifications (not generic)
- Realistic amounts (help with context - what does equipment actually cost?)
- Tying line items to strategic plans

Circulate actively. Review each trainee's line items for:
- Specificity: "10 desktop computers" not "equipment"
- Adequate justification: Ties to strategic objective
- Reasonable amounts: Not wildly unrealistic
- Diversity: Covering multiple categories
- Required fields all completed

Ministry-specific guidance:
- **MOH**: Personnel (doctors, nurses), Medical supplies, Equipment (diagnostic machines), Training (emergency care), Outreach programs
- **MOLE**: Personnel (labor inspectors), Skills training programs, Equipment (training facilities), Job fair costs, Employer outreach
- **MAFAR**: Personnel (agricultural extension workers), Seeds/fertilizer, Irrigation equipment, Farmer training, Market development

Ensure compliance check shows green before allowing trainees to proceed."

---

### Slide 37: Budget Summary & Compliance
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Budget Summary & Compliance Check

**Key Talking Points:**
- Budget summary panel updates in real-time as you add line items
- Shows: Total amount, line item count, breakdown by category (pie chart)
- **Compliance indicators**:
  - ✅ Green checkmark: Fully compliant, ready to submit
  - ⚠️ Yellow warning: Minor issues (e.g., missing optional fields)
  - ❌ Red X: Critical issues blocking submission
- Common compliance issues:
  - Fewer than 5 line items
  - Missing justifications
  - Total exceeds MOA budget ceiling
  - No line items in required categories (Personnel, MOOE)
- Budget ceiling: Each MOA has maximum allowable budget set by BARMM

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Large screenshot of Budget Summary panel with annotations
- Three compliance status badges (green, yellow, red) with explanations
- Example pie chart showing category breakdown
- Budget ceiling warning example: "Total: PHP 30M | Ceiling: PHP 25M | OVER by PHP 5M" (red text)
- Compliance checklist with checkmarks/X marks

**Speaker Notes:**
"As you add line items, watch the budget summary panel on the right. This is your real-time compliance dashboard. The pie chart shows your allocation across categories - if 90% is in Personnel Services, that's unbalanced and the system will warn you. Bill No. 325 recommends 40-60% for personnel, 20-30% for MOOE, 10-20% for capital outlay. See the compliance check at top? Green means good to go. Yellow means minor issues - maybe you forgot to fill in optional notes. Red means critical problems - you can't submit until fixed. Most common red issue: Total budget exceeds your ministry's ceiling. Each MOA has a maximum budget assigned by BARMM. If you go over, you need to either reduce line items or request a ceiling increase from Budget Office."

---

### Slide 38: Submission & Approval Workflow
**Complexity:** Complex

**Title:** Submitting Your Budget for Approval

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Pre-submission checklist**: Minimum 5 line items, all required fields, compliance check green, total within ceiling, justifications complete
- **Approval chain** (amount-based thresholds):
  - Up to PHP 1M: Department Head approval
  - PHP 1M - PHP 5M: MOA Finance Officer approval
  - PHP 5M - PHP 25M: MOA Executive/Minister approval
  - PHP 25M - PHP 50M: BARMM Budget Office review
  - Over PHP 50M: Bangsamoro Parliament legislative approval
- Higher amounts require multiple approvals in sequence
- Approvers can: Approve, Return for revision, or Reject
- **Returned budgets**: View feedback, make changes, resubmit
- Once fully approved, budget becomes active for fiscal year

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Approval chain diagram showing 5 levels with threshold amounts
- Workflow flowchart: Submit → Level 1 → Level 2 → Level 3 → Approved
- Alternative paths: → Returned for Revision → Edit → Resubmit OR → Rejected → Start Over
- Status badges at each stage
- Example approver notification email
- Screenshot of feedback panel when budget returned

**Speaker Notes:**
"Budget approval is serious business - you're requesting public funds. Bill No. 325 mandates multi-level approval based on amount. Small budgets (under 1 million) only need department head approval. Medium budgets (1-5 million) need finance officer approval. Large budgets (5-25 million) need your minister's approval. Very large budgets (over 50 million) require Parliament to vote! Most pilot ministry budgets will likely be in the 5-25 million range, requiring minister approval. The approval process is sequential - it goes level by level. If your finance officer returns your budget with feedback 'Need more detail on training line items,' you make changes and resubmit. Once all required levels approve, status changes to 'Approved' and you can start tracking expenditures."

---

### Slide 39: Budget Monitoring & Expenditure Tracking
**Complexity:** Complex

**Title:** After Approval: Monitoring Budget Execution

**Key Talking Points:**
- Approved budgets aren't set-and-forget - track expenditures against approved line items
- **Recording expenditures**: When you spend money, log it in BMMS
- Required fields: Line item (which budget line), amount spent, expense date, description, vendor/payee, reference number (invoice/receipt)
- **Supporting documents required** for amounts over PHP 50,000
- Budget dashboard shows: Total approved, total spent, remaining balance, utilization percentage
- Real-time updates: Expenditure recorded → Budget balance decreases → Utilization % increases
- **Quarterly reporting**: Bill No. 325 requires expenditure reports every quarter (Q1-Q4)

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Budget monitoring dashboard screenshot with annotations
- Expenditure recording form screenshot
- Before/After comparison:
  - Before expenditure: "Line Item: PHP 3M approved | PHP 0 spent | PHP 3M remaining"
  - After expenditure: "Line Item: PHP 3M approved | PHP 500K spent | PHP 2.5M remaining"
- Monthly burn rate line chart
- Quarterly report template preview

**Speaker Notes:**
"Approval is the beginning, not the end. As your ministry spends funds throughout the year, you log expenditures in BMMS. When you purchase 10 desktop computers for PHP 500,000, you record that against your Capital Outlay > Equipment line item. The system tracks how much you've spent versus approved amount. The budget dashboard shows real-time utilization. This serves multiple purposes: First, it prevents overspending - you can't exceed approved amounts. Second, it provides transparency - anyone with access can see spending patterns. Third, it enables quarterly reporting. Bill No. 325 requires you to submit expenditure reports to BARMM Budget Office every quarter. BMMS generates these reports automatically from recorded expenditures."

### Slide 40: Budget Planning Best Practices
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Tips for Effective Budget Planning

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Base on historical data**: Review past spending patterns, don't guess
- **Align with strategy**: Every line item should support a strategic objective
- **Build in contingency**: Include 5-10% buffer for unexpected costs
- **Be realistic**: Don't inflate amounts hoping for cuts - propose what you actually need
- **Document assumptions**: Note assumptions (e.g., "Assumes 10% inflation on supplies")
- **Engage stakeholders**: Consult department heads and program managers before finalizing
- **Start early**: Budget cycle is months long - don't wait until deadline
- **Maintain documentation**: Keep receipts, invoices, and supporting documents organized

**Visual Suggestions:**
- 8 best practice cards with icons
- Do's and Don'ts comparison table:
  - ✅ DO: Base on data, Align with strategy, Include contingency, Be realistic
  - ❌ DON'T: Guess amounts, Inflate costs, Miss deadlines, Lose receipts
- Timeline showing budget cycle (Planning → Submission → Approval → Execution → Reporting)
- Quote from ministry finance officer: "The budget that gets approved is the one with clear justifications"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Let me share budget wisdom from experienced finance officers. First, look backward before looking forward. Pull last year's expenditure reports. If you spent PHP 500K on office supplies last year, why would you need PHP 2M this year? Have a reason. Second, tie every line item to strategy. Don't just say 'We need training.' Say 'We need emergency obstetric care training to achieve Strategic Objective 1.' Third, include contingency. Inflation happens, equipment breaks, emergencies arise. A 5-10% buffer is prudent. Fourth, be honest. Padding your budget hoping approvers will cut it undermines trust. Propose what you actually need with solid justifications. Finally, start early. Budget preparation takes time. Rushed budgets have errors and weak justifications. Give yourself months, not weeks."

## SECTION 5: COORDINATION & CALENDAR (Slides 41-50)

### Slide 41: Coordination Module Overview
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Module 3: Coordination & Inter-MOA Collaboration

**Key Talking Points:**
- Purpose: Facilitate partnerships and joint activities between ministries
- **Core principle**: While internal ministry data is private, partnerships are shared
- Key features: Create partnerships, manage joint activities, track collaboration outcomes
- Partnership types: Bilateral (2 MOAs), Multilateral (3+ MOAs), Network (ongoing coalition)
- Real-world example: MOH + MOLE partnership for "Health Worker Employment Program"

**Visual Suggestions:**
- Module icon (handshake with multiple MOA logos)
- Partnership visualization: MOH ↔ MOLE (bilateral), MOH ↔ MOLE ↔ MAFAR (multilateral)
- Workflow diagram: Create Partnership → Add Partner MOAs → Define Goals → Manage Activities → Track Outcomes
- Screenshot of partnerships list page
- Real-world partnership example card

**Speaker Notes:**
"This afternoon's second module is about collaboration. BARMM's biggest opportunities come from MOAs working together. Imagine MOH training community health workers, and MOLE certifying them for employment - that's collaboration. Or MAFAR teaching nutrition through agriculture, and MOH providing health screenings at farm training sites. The Coordination module makes these partnerships visible and manageable. Unlike your internal data which is private, partnerships are shared - all participating MOAs see partnership details. This transparency enables true collaboration."

**Speaker Notes:**
"Partnerships without activities are just words on paper. Activities are where collaboration happens. Under your MOH-MOLE partnership, you might create an activity: 'Joint Health Worker Recruitment Fair' scheduled for March 15, 2025 in Cotabato City. MOH provides health screenings to applicants, MOLE conducts employment interviews, and both jointly select candidates. After the event, you update the activity with outcomes: '85 applicants attended, 40 selected for training program, 12 hired immediately.' These activity logs create a record of collaboration and demonstrate partnership impact."

### Slide 46: Coordination & Calendar Best Practices
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Best Practices for Collaboration & Scheduling

**Key Talking Points:**
- **Partnerships**: Start with clear objectives, define roles upfront, regular check-ins (monthly)
- **Activities**: Log everything - even small activities count, update outcomes after completion
- **Communication**: Use BMMS messaging for partnership discussions (keeps record in system)
- **Calendar**: Block focus time for deep work, distinguish event types with colors, use reminders liberally
- **Data sharing**: Only share data authorized for inter-MOA access, respect partner privacy
- **Conflict resolution**: Address disagreements promptly using BMMS issue tracking, escalate to OCM if needed

**Visual Suggestions:**
- 6 best practice cards with icons
- Partnership success factors diagram
- Calendar time-blocking example
- Do's and Don'ts table
- Quote from successful partnership: "Regular communication was key"

**Speaker Notes:**
"Inter-MOA collaboration is new territory for many BARMM ministries. Learn from others' successes. First, successful partnerships have crystal-clear objectives from day one. Vague goals lead to confusion. Second, define roles upfront: Who's doing what? Who's accountable? Third, schedule regular check-ins. We recommend monthly coordination meetings for active partnerships. For calendars, use color coding religiously - glance at your calendar and immediately know what type of event it is. Block focus time on your calendar - treat it like a meeting with yourself. And use reminders generously - better too many than missing a deadline."

### Slide 55: User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Information
**Complexity:** Moderate

**Title:** Your Role in UAT: The Next 3 Months

**Key Talking Points:**
- **UAT period**: 3 months starting today
- **Your responsibilities**:
  - Use BMMS daily for real work (not just training scenarios)
  - Log feedback when you encounter issues or have suggestions
  - Attend bi-weekly feedback sessions with your ministry champion
  - Complete monthly UAT surveys
  - Report critical bugs immediately
- **Feedback categories**: Bugs (something broken), Usability (hard to use), Feature requests (new functionality), Performance (slow loading)
- **How to submit feedback**: Help → Submit Feedback OR click "Report Issue" icon on any page
- **What happens to feedback**: Dev team reviews, prioritizes, and implements before full rollout

**Visual Suggestions:**
- UAT timeline showing 3-month pilot period
- Feedback form screenshot with category selection
- Bi-weekly feedback session calendar
- Feedback loop diagram: Submit → Review → Prioritize → Implement → Notify You
- Bug severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

**Speaker Notes:**
"Today is just the beginning. Over the next 3 months, you're User Acceptance Testers - UAT for short. This means you use BMMS for real work daily and give us honest feedback. If something's confusing, tell us. If a button doesn't work, report it. If you wish BMMS could do something it doesn't, request it. We want all feedback - good, bad, ugly. Every two weeks, your ministry champion will host a feedback session where you discuss experiences as a group. You'll also complete monthly surveys. For critical bugs - system crashes, data loss - report immediately via 'Report Issue' button. Every piece of feedback helps us improve BMMS before all 44 MOAs join."
