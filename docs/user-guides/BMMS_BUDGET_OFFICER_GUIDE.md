to 50 remote schools, addressing the low literacy rate of 60% in
underserved Bangsamoro communities."

2. OBJECTIVES
-------------
[List specific, measurable objectives this budget will achieve]

Example:
- Train 500 teachers in literacy education methods

- Establish 20 community reading centers

3. ALIGNMENT WITH STRATEGIC PLAN

among Bangsamoro youth. Directly supports Key Result 2: Train 200
teachers in literacy methods by September 2025."

4. EXPECTED OUTCOMES
--------------------
[Describe measurable outcomes and impact]

cost; (2) Online-only training - limited effectiveness in remote
areas; (3) Selected approach - balanced cost and effectiveness."

8. IMPLEMENTATION TIMELINE

CLARIFICATION REQUEST

Please clarify:
- How many participants per workshop?
- What is included in the PHP 50,000?
- Is this rate competitive compared to external training providers?"

YOUR RESPONSE:
"Thank you for the clarification request.

Training Workshop Details:
- Participants: 50 teachers per workshop
- Cost per participant: PHP 1,000

Cost Breakdown (per workshop):
- Venue rental: PHP 15,000 (3 days)
- Meals and snacks: PHP 25,000 (50 pax x 3 days x PHP 167/day)
- Training materials: PHP 5,000 (50 kits)
- Trainer fees: PHP 15,000 (2 trainers x 3 days)

TOTAL: PHP 50,000

Competitiveness:

### 8.3 Budget Utilization Monitoring

**Utilization Dashboard:**

Access real-time budget utilization:
- Go to Budgeting Module → Dashboard
- View utilization cards and charts

**Key Metrics:**

**Obligation Rate:**
```
Obligated Amount / Total Allocation x 100

Example: PHP 1,600,000 / PHP 2,000,000 x 100 = 80%

Interpretation:
- 80% of budget committed
- 20% still available for new commitments
```

**Disbursement Rate:**
```
Disbursed Amount / Total Allocation x 100

Example: PHP 1,400,000 / PHP 2,000,000 x 100 = 70%

Interpretation:
- 70% of budget actually spent
- 30% either uncommitted or committed but not yet paid
```

**Utilization Efficiency:**
```
Disbursed Amount / Obligated Amount x 100

Example: PHP 1,400,000 / PHP 1,600,000 x 100 = 87.5%

Interpretation:
- 87.5% of commitments have been paid
- 12.5% committed but awaiting payment (normal pipeline)
```
