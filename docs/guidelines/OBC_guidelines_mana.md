# GUIDELINES FOR THE CONSULTATIONS AND MAPPING AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT (MANA) FOR OTHER BANGSAMORO COMMUNITIES (OBCs)

---

## I. LEGAL BASIS

These guidelines are issued pursuant to the **Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL)**, which mandates the protection of the rights of the Bangsamoro people, including those residing outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). The BOL also mandates the Bangsamoro Government to undertake interventions for the economic, social, and cultural development of **Other Bangsamoro Communities (OBCs)** in coordination with **local government units (LGUs)** where these communities are located and the appropriate **national government agencies (NGAs)**.

In accordance with the **Bangsamoro Administrative Code**, the **Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (OOBC)** under the **Office of the Chief Minister (OCM)** is tasked to recommend policies and programs addressing the development needs of OBCs and to ensure that services are responsive to their conditions and aspirations.

The Bangsamoro Administrative Code further provides that the OOBC shall gather information and assess the economic, social, and cultural needs of OBCs. The **Consultations and Mapping and Needs Assessment (MANA)** are established as key mechanisms for fulfilling this mandate, incorporating both spatial and thematic analyses to inform policy recommendations and program development.

---

## II. CORE PRINCIPLES

The consultations and MANA for OBCs follow a set of core principles to ensure the processes are inclusive, effective, and aligned with the overarching goals of the OOBC. These principles underpin every activity undertaken during the consultations and needs assessments.

- **Inclusivity**: The processes must ensure meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders, including OBC leaders, community members, local government officials, national government representatives, and marginalized groups such as women, youth, and persons with disabilities. Representation shall span various geographic locations, socio-economic backgrounds, and cultural contexts.
- **Transparency**: Stakeholders shall have access to clear and open communication channels with regular updates. Accountability mechanisms shall ensure data collection and recommendations rely on accurate and reliable information.
- **Consistency**: Standardized and validated tools and methodologies shall be used for data collection and analysis. A comprehensive approach shall combine quantitative and qualitative methods (e.g., surveys, interviews, focus groups, geospatial mapping).
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: The processes shall respect the cultural heritage, traditions, and practices of Bangsamoro communities, using accessible languages and communication styles.
- **Confidentiality**: Personal and sensitive information shall be handled with strict confidentiality per data protection laws, adhering to ethical standards with informed consent from participants.
- **Sustainability**: Consultations, MANA activities, and interventions shall prioritize long-term viability, supported by capacity-building for OOBC personnel and community members.
- **Collaboration**: OOBC, BMOAs, LGUs, NGAs, and other agencies shall maintain strong collaboration to leverage resources and expertise, promoting community ownership through local involvement.
- **Adaptability**: The processes shall remain flexible to address changing circumstances, using feedback loops and iterative procedures to refine methodologies.
- **Evidence-Based**: Policy recommendations and programs shall be based on robust data and thorough analysis, integrating spatial and thematic data for informed decision-making.
- **Equity**: Interventions shall promote equitable access to resources and opportunities, prioritizing support for vulnerable and marginalized segments within OBCs.

## III. CONSULTATIONS AND MANA GUIDELINES

This section provides clear guidelines for conducting consultations and implementing the **Mapping and Needs Assessment (MANA)** to ensure effective engagement with OBC stakeholders and support initiatives addressing their needs and priorities.

### A. CONSULTATIONS

Consultations aim to gather inputs, address concerns, and integrate community insights into Bangsamoro Government programs and services for OBCs, ensuring inclusivity, cultural sensitivity, and active participation.

- **Standalone Consultations**:
  - Serve as primary mechanisms for direct engagement to gather input on pressing needs, maintain dialogue, identify emerging issues, and facilitate coordination.
  - Establish platforms for information dissemination about BARMM programs and services.
  - Conducted regularly across regions with representation from OBC leaders, members, LGUs, NGAs, BMOAs, vulnerable sectors (women, youth, elderly, persons with disabilities), and civil society organizations.
  - Require coordination with local authorities, two-week prior notification, multilingual materials, culturally sensitive facilitation, gender-balanced participation, and accessibility measures.
  - Documented via detailed proceedings, attendance records, photos, audio (with consent), and written submissions, including context, objectives, participant info, key points, recommendations, and follow-up mechanisms.
  - Reports submitted: initial summary (5 working days), comprehensive report (20 working days), quarterly consolidated reports.
  - Monitored via a database tracking issues, recommendations, and commitments, with working groups overseeing implementation.

- **MANA-Integrated Consultations**:
  - Validate initial findings, gather qualitative insights, ensure community perspectives in needs assessment, identify investigation priorities, and build community ownership.
  - Timed with assessment phases: pre-assessment (baseline), mid-assessment (preliminary validation), post-assessment (final verification).
  - Validated through community-level verification, technical validation with experts, cross-referencing with existing data, and comparative analysis.
  - Supported by continuous feedback channels (dialogue sessions, online forms, suggestion boxes, social media), systematically recorded and analyzed.

- **General Requirements**: Maintain comprehensive documentation, adapt to local contexts, and ensure stakeholder coordination.

### B. MULTI-PHASE APPROACH IN CONDUCTING THE OBC MANA

This outlines sequential steps integrating standalone and MANA-integrated consultations for stakeholder engagement and responsiveness.

- **Pre-Assessment Phase**:
  - Secure formal agreements with BMOAs, LGUs, and NGAs for access and cooperation.
  - Conduct desk research (e.g., PSA reports, OOBC studies) to identify concerns across Social, Economic, Cultural, and Rights dimensions.
  - Develop standardized tools, training, and protocols based on initial consultations.
  - Identify target sites and thematic focus areas with community and local official input.

- **Baseline Mapping and Data Collection Phase**:
  - Use mixed methods (surveys, focus groups, interviews, GIS) to gather data, validated via MANA-integrated consultations.
  - Employ digital tools (e.g., KoBo Toolbox, GIS) for demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and rights data, incorporating consultation feedback.
  - Involve local enumerators and representatives, with field-level consultations ensuring inclusivity.
  - Validate preliminary data through community discussions and expert reviews.

- **Thematic In-Depth Studies Phase**:
  - Conduct specialized assessments in Social (health, education), Economic (livelihoods, infrastructure), Cultural (heritage), and Rights (equity, discrimination) categories.
  - Engage experts and use MANA-integrated consultations to refine inquiries and fill gaps.
  - Examine cross-cutting factors (gender, youth, disability) via focused consultations.

- **Synthesis and Prioritization Phase**:
  - Consolidate findings into an analytical framework linked to consultation insights.
  - Apply prioritization criteria (urgency, feasibility, impact, Moral Governance) via validation workshops.
  - Gather stakeholder feedback to ensure priorities reflect community values.

- **Recommendation and Action Planning Phase**:
  - Translate priorities into policy recommendations and program proposals, reviewed with stakeholders.
  - Outline action points, timelines, and resources, clarifying responsibilities and partnerships.
  - Develop accessible communication strategies (briefs, infographics) refined with community feedback.

- **Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) Phase**:
  - Establish baseline indicators and targets informed by community inputs.
  - Schedule periodic assessments (12-24 months) with consultative reviews.
  - Integrate MEL results into future MANA cycles for continuous adaptation.
