# GUIDELINES ON CRAFTING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OTHER BANGSAMORO COMMUNITIES (OBCs)

---

## I. LEGAL BASES

These guidelines are issued pursuant to the **Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL)**, which mandates the protection of the rights of the Bangsamoro people residing outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM) and the enhancement of their economic, social, and cultural development.

The **Bangsamoro Administrative Code** provides the legal framework for the **Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (OOBC)** under the **Office of the Chief Minister (OCM)** to recommend policies, programs, and services that address the needs of OBCs.

The Bangsamoro Administrative Code further assigns the OOBC the task of gathering information and assessing the economic, social, and cultural conditions of OBCs. This ensures that recommended interventions remain **evidence-based**, responsive, and aligned with the OBCs’ priorities and aspirations.

---

## II. SCOPE

These guidelines apply to all policy recommendations developed by the OOBC and relevant **Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs)** for the welfare, rights, and development of OBCs.

The guidelines cover the entire process of formulating policy recommendations, from the initial assessment of identified needs—whether focused on a single intervention or covering multiple, holistic initiatives—to the submission of proposals for consideration by the Chief Minister, his Cabinet, and the Bangsamoro Parliament.

These guidelines offer a flexible structure accommodating:
- Targeted recommendations.
- Clustered or thematic recommendations derived from consultation and **Mapping and Needs Assessment (MANA)** reports aimed at comprehensive protection of rights and socio-economic and cultural enhancement of OBCs.

The scope includes drafting, validation, refinement, and formal endorsement of policy recommendations to ensure consistency, relevance, adaptability, and responsiveness to emerging OBC conditions and policy environments.

---

## III. DEFINITIONS

- **Policy Recommendations**: Proposed courses of action, policy instruments, or strategic measures intended to guide decision-makers in improving conditions for OBCs, ranging from narrowly focused solutions (e.g., scholarships for OBC students) to broader, multi-sectoral proposals enhancing economic, social, cultural, and rights conditions.
- **Mapping and Needs Assessment (MANA)**: Processes and methodologies employed by the OOBC and concerned agencies to gather and analyze spatial, demographic, socio-economic, cultural, and rights-related data on OBCs, serving as a key evidence base for policy recommendations.
- **Consultations**: Structured engagements with OBC representatives, local leaders, technical experts, community members, and stakeholders to validate findings, identify priorities, and align recommendations with OBC interests and cultural values.
- **Evidence-Based Approach**: Reliance on credible data sources (MANA findings, consultation results, research studies, official statistics) to inform policy formulation, grounding recommendations in objective, verifiable information rather than assumptions or anecdotal evidence.

---

## IV. CORE PRINCIPLES

- **Evidence-Based**: Recommendations shall rely on credible data from MANA, consultations, official statistics, and research studies to address actual community needs.
- **Inclusivity**: Policy drafting shall involve women, youth, persons with disabilities, and marginalized groups, respecting cultural heritage, linguistic diversity, and local traditions to foster community ownership and trust.
- **Flexibility**: Proposals may range from narrow interventions to integrated packages addressing multiple OBC development facets, accommodating immediate and long-term needs.
- **Adaptability**: Recommendations shall be reviewed and revised as new data, conditions, or priorities emerge, considering socio-economic, resource, and governance shifts.
- **Alignment**: Proposals shall align with laws, strategic plans (e.g., Bangsamoro Development Plan), and existing interventions to prevent duplication and enhance collaboration.
- **Moral Governance**: Recommendations shall uphold ethical conduct, justice, transparency, and accountability to ensure fairness and long-term OBC welfare.
- **Communication**: Open lines with OBC representatives, leaders, and stakeholders shall ensure alignment with community aspirations through continuous feedback and dialogue.

## V. PROCEDURES FOR CRAFTING POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS

### A. PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT

- Drafting teams shall examine applicable laws, sectoral strategies (e.g., Bangsamoro Development Plan), and prior consultations/MANA findings to identify gaps and opportunities.
- Collect evidence from quantitative indicators, qualitative insights, cultural considerations, and past interventions to uphold an evidence-based approach.
- Prepare a preliminary assessment report summarizing key findings and highlighting areas needing policy interventions, clarifying whether single or clustered measures are suitable.

### B. FORMULATION OF POLICY OPTIONS

- Translate needs into preliminary policy options aligned with OBC contexts, incorporating MANA, consultation, and research evidence.
- Options may include single interventions (e.g., scholarships) or multi-sectoral approaches (rights, economic, social, cultural).
- Ensure measures uphold Moral Governance, evaluating resources, feasibility, outcomes, and synergy with existing interventions.

### C. STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AND VALIDATION

- Present proposals to OBC representatives, leaders, BMOAs, LGUs, NGAs, and stakeholders for feedback, expediting or skipping this step in emergencies (e.g., displacement).
- Use dialogues, focus groups, workshops, or expert reviews to ensure inclusivity and transparency.
- Refine options based on validated inputs to reflect OBC realities and strengthen community trust.

### D. PRIORITIZATION AND REFINEMENT

- Classify recommendations by importance and urgency:
  - **Category A: High Importance – High Urgency**: Critical, immediate-impact measures.
  - **Category B: High Importance – Low Urgency**: Essential, phased interventions.
  - **Category C: Low Importance – Low Urgency**: Supportive, future-oriented proposals.
- Propose combining standalone and thematic interventions to enhance welfare and avoid duplication.
- Ensure final recommendations are detailed yet adjustable to resource or context changes.

### E. PREPARATION OF POLICY RECOMMENDATION BRIEFS

- Classify each measure per Section D categories before drafting briefs.
- Prepare standardized, flexible briefs for single or multi-faceted proposals, including:
  - **Executive Summary**: Overview, beneficiaries, outcomes.
  - **Background, Rationale, and Evidence Base**: Problem, MANA/consultation data, legal frameworks.
  - **Policy Objectives**: Clear, measurable goals.
  - **Proposed Interventions**: Actions, timelines, agencies, budgets.
  - **Anticipated Impact**: Short- and long-term benefits, equity, sustainability.
  - **Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) Plan**: Indicators, baselines, tracking mechanisms.
  - **Risk Analysis**: Risks (funding, logistics) and mitigation strategies.
  - **Conclusions and Next Steps**: Summary, roadmap for approvals.
  - **Appendices**: Data tables, technical designs, references.
- Cite sources (e.g., BOL, Administrative Code) consistently, anonymize sensitive data, use clear visuals, avoid jargon, and maintain a formal tone with numbered sections.
- Review internally for accuracy and Moral Governance alignment, highlighting ethical values and synergies with existing initiatives.

### F. INTERNAL REVIEW AND ENDORSEMENT WITHIN OOBC

- Review for legal (BOL, Administrative Code), technical, Moral Governance, and synergy compliance.
- Request clarifications or revisions, consolidating feedback for drafting teams.
- The **Executive Director (ED)** certifies alignment via memorandum, endorsing submission to OCM or legislative bodies.

### G. SUBMISSION TO THE OFFICE OF THE CHIEF MINISTER

- Submit a package with:
  - Policy Recommendation Brief(s).
  - Cover Memorandum: Highlights, Moral Governance alignment, categories.
  - Legal/Technical Documents: References, studies.
- Provide clarifications if requested, ensuring governance and feasibility standards.
- Request OCM acknowledgment to track submission.

### H. FOLLOW-UP

- Track submissions via a dashboard (dates, steps, deadlines).
- Communicate with OCM for updates, discussing feasibility or revisions.
- Request formal decisions for approvals, adjusting proposals if constrained.
- Coordinate with implementers post-approval, documenting decisions and monitoring outcomes per M&E plans.
- Escalate unresolved issues to OCM or Parliament if stalled.

## VI. DOCUMENTATION AND RECORD-KEEPING

- Maintain records of sources, minutes, consultations, and drafts for transparency.
