- Check dependencies before starting tasks

❌ **DON'T:**

- Assign tasks without consulting the person
- Set vague due dates ("sometime next month")

### Project Management

✅ **DO:**

- Link needs to PPAs for traceability
- Set realistic milestones
- Update progress as work completes
- Use workflow stages for budget approval
- Involve all stakeholders in planning
- Document budget changes

❌ **DON'T:**

- Create PPAs without linking to needs
- Skip workflow stages
- Forget to assign team members
- Leave progress at 0% for months

### Performance Tips

**Keep the system fast:**

- Use filters instead of viewing everything
- Archive completed PPAs after fiscal year
- Clear browser cache monthly
- Close unused browser tabs

## Troubleshooting

### Calendar Not Loading

1. **Refresh the page** (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
2. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Chrome: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Firefox: Ctrl+Shift+Delete
   - Safari: Cmd+Option+E
3. **Check module filters** - Some might be unchecked
4. **Try different view** (Month → Week → List)
5. **Contact IT support** if issue persists

### Tasks Not Appearing

**Problem**: Created assessment/PPA but no tasks generated

**Solutions:**

1. **Refresh task dashboard**
2. **Check if task template exists** for that type

**Problem**: Status dropdown is disabled or changes don't save

**Solutions:**

1. **Check you're assigned** to the task

4. **Refresh the page** and try again
5. **Contact your coordinator** if you need reassignment

### PPA Progress Not Updating

**Problem**: Completed tasks but PPA progress stays the same

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify tasks are linked** to the PPA

3. **Refresh PPA detail page**
4. **Manually update** if needed (you can override)
5. **Report to administrator** if calculation seems wrong
