## Integration Status

### Template Registry
**File:** `src/common/ai_services/chat/query_templates/__init__.py`

All 4 new categories automatically registered:
```python
# WORKSTREAM 6: New Query Categories (120 templates across 4 domains)
try:
    from common.ai_services.chat.query_templates.temporal import TEMPORAL_TEMPLATES
    registry.register_many(TEMPORAL_TEMPLATES)
    logger.info(f"Registered {len(TEMPORAL_TEMPLATES)} temporal templates")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to register temporal templates: {e}")

# Similar for cross_domain, analytics, comparison...
```

- Required/optional entity extraction
- Priority-based template selection (6-9 range)
- Category-based organization

### Django ORM Queries
- Efficient annotations and aggregations
- Prefetch/select_related for performance
- Time-based filters with timedelta
- Statistical functions (Avg, Sum, Count, etc.)

### Cross-Module Relationships
- Communities ↔ MANA (assessments)
- MANA ↔ Coordination (partnerships, stakeholders)
- Needs → Policies → PPAs (complete pipeline)
- Geographic hierarchy (Region → Province → Municipality → Barangay)

## Known Limitations

### Query Template Limitations
1. **Dynamic filtering** - Some queries need runtime entity extraction
2. **Complex aggregations** - Advanced stats may require query builders
3. **Multi-model joins** - Some cross-domain queries need optimization

### Future Enhancements
1. **Query builders** for dynamic template generation
2. **Advanced statistics** (regression, clustering algorithms)
3. **Real-time updates** for trend monitoring
4. **Custom aggregations** for specific business needs
