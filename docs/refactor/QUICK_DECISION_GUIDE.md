# Unified Work Hierarchy - Quick Decision Guide

**⏱️ 5-Minute Read for Decision Makers**

---

## 🎯 What Are We Deciding?

**Should we refactor OBCMS to use a unified hierarchical work management system?**

**Current:** 3 separate systems (Tasks, Projects, Activities)
**Proposed:** 1 unified system with full hierarchy support

---

## ✅ Benefits (Why Do This?)

### 1. **Professional Work Breakdown Structure**
   - Projects → Sub-Projects → Activities → Tasks → Subtasks
   - Industry-standard hierarchical planning
   - Clear work decomposition

### 2. **Unified User Experience**
   - One form for all work types
   - Consistent interface
   - Less user confusion

### 3. **Better Visibility**
   - See entire project tree
   - Track dependencies
   - Complete calendar view

### 4. **Technical Efficiency**
   - 50% less code duplication
   - Single model to maintain
   - Faster development of new features

---

## ⚠️ Risks (Why Not?)

### 1. **High Migration Complexity**
   - 6-8 weeks development time
   - Risk of data loss (mitigated with dual-write)
   - Team unavailable for other features

### 2. **MPTT Concurrency Issues**
   - Potential deadlocks on concurrent saves
   - Mitigation: Database locking, retry logic

### 3. **Performance Unknown**
   - Need to test with production data volume
   - Mitigation: Proper indexing, caching

## 💰 Resource Requirements

| Resource | Requirement | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| **Development Time** | 6-8 weeks | Full-time developer |
| **Testing Time** | 2 weeks | Overlaps with development |
| **Database Downtime** | ~2 hours | For final migration |
| **Training** | 1 day | User training on new UI |
| **New Dependencies** | django-mppt | Stable, widely-used |

**Total Cost Estimate:** 6-8 weeks of 1 FTE developer

## 📊 Go/No-Go Criteria

### ✅ **GO** If:
- [ ] You need complex work hierarchies (sub-projects, sub-activities)
- [ ] 6-8 weeks of development time is available
- [ ] Unified work management is a strategic priority
- [ ] Team can handle migration complexity
- [ ] Current 3-model system is limiting productivity

### ❌ **NO-GO** If:
- [ ] No resource for 6-8 week project
- [ ] Current system meets all needs
- [ ] Higher-priority features exist
- [ ] Migration risk is unacceptable
- [ ] Hierarchies beyond 2 levels are rare

---

## 🔄 Alternatives (Middle Ground)

### Option 1: **Incremental Enhancement** (LOW RISK)
   - **Effort:** 1-2 weeks
   - **What:** Add subtask support to existing Task model only
   - **Benefit:** Subtasks without full refactoring
   - **Limitation:** Still 3 separate models

### Option 2: **Enhanced Integration** (VERY LOW RISK)
   - **Effort:** 1 week
   - **What:** Improve UI to unify views (virtual unification)
   - **Benefit:** Better UX, no migration
   - **Limitation:** No true hierarchy, technical debt remains

### Option 3: **Do Nothing** (ZERO RISK)
   - **Effort:** 0 weeks
   - **What:** Keep current system
   - **Benefit:** No cost, no risk
   - **Limitation:** Continued limitations

---

## 📈 Expected Outcomes (If Implemented)

### Immediate (Week 6-8)
- ✅ All work types in unified system
- ✅ Hierarchical work breakdown
- ✅ Calendar shows all items
- ✅ Single form interface

### Short-term (Month 2-3)
- ✅ 50% reduction in code duplication
- ✅ Faster feature development
- ✅ Improved user productivity
- ✅ Better project visibility

### Long-term (Month 6+)
- ✅ Gantt charts, advanced planning
- ✅ Work templates
- ✅ Scalable architecture
- ✅ Industry-standard PM system

## 🚦 Decision Framework

### **Question 1:** Do we need sub-projects and sub-activities?
- **Yes → +2 points for GO**
- **No → +1 point for NO-GO**

### **Question 2:** Is 6-8 weeks of dev time available?
- **Yes → +2 points for GO**
- **No → +2 points for NO-GO**

### **Question 3:** Is unified work management strategic?
- **Yes → +3 points for GO**
- **No → +1 point for Alternative**

### **Question 4:** Can team handle migration complexity?
- **Yes → +1 point for GO**
- **No → +2 points for Alternative**

### **Scoring:**
- **7+ points for GO:** Proceed with full implementation
- **4-6 points:** Consider Alternative (Incremental)
- **<4 points:** NO-GO (keep current system)

## ⏭️ Next Steps (Based on Decision)

### If **GO**:
1. ✅ Week 1: Create feature branch, prototype WorkItem model
2. ✅ Week 1-2: Test migration scripts on dev database
3. ✅ Week 2: Present prototype to team
4. ✅ Week 3: Begin Phase 1 (Model Creation)
5. ✅ Week 6-8: Go-live

### If **ALTERNATIVE** (Incremental):
1. ✅ Week 1: Add subtask support to StaffTask
2. ✅ Week 1-2: Test and deploy
3. ✅ Re-evaluate in Q2/Q3 for full refactoring

### If **NO-GO**:
1. ✅ Document decision rationale
2. ✅ Archive evaluation for future reference
3. ✅ Continue with current system
4. ✅ Re-evaluate in 6-12 months

## 📋 Recommendation

### 🎯 **PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: GO**

**Why:**
- Modern PM systems need hierarchical work breakdown
- Technical feasibility confirmed (MPTT is proven)
- Long-term benefits outweigh short-term effort
- Phased migration minimizes risk

### ⚙️ **FALLBACK: ALTERNATIVE (Incremental)**

**If resources constrained:**
- Start with subtask support only
- Defer full refactoring to next quarter
- Low risk, immediate value

## 📞 Questions to Resolve

**For Stakeholders:**
1. What's the strategic priority of hierarchical work management?
2. Is 6-8 weeks of development time available in Q4 2025 / Q1 2026?
3. What's the tolerance for migration complexity/risk?

**For Technical Team:**
1. Can we allocate 1 FTE for 6-8 weeks?
2. Is testing environment ready for migration trials?
