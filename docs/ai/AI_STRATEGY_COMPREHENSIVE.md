### 3.3 Vector Database for Semantic Search

**Architecture:**

```python
# src/ai_assistant/services/vector_store.py
import faiss
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict
from openai import OpenAI

class VectorStore:
    """FAISS-based vector store for semantic search."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.client = OpenAI(api_key=settings.OPENAI_API_KEY)
        self.index = self._load_or_create_index()
        self.metadata = self._load_metadata()

    def embed_text(self, text: str) -> np.ndarray:
        """Generate embedding for text."""
        response = self.client.embeddings.create(
            model="text-embedding-3-small",
            input=text
        )
        return np.array(response.data[0].embedding)

    def index_record(self, record_id: str, text: str, metadata: Dict):
        """Index a record for semantic search."""
        embedding = self.embed_text(text)
        self.index.add(embedding.reshape(1, -1))
        self.metadata[record_id] = metadata

    def search(self, query: str, k: int = 10) -> List[Dict]:
        """Semantic search across all indexed records."""
        query_embedding = self.embed_text(query)
        distances, indices = self.index.search(
            query_embedding.reshape(1, -1), k
        )

        results = []
        for idx, distance in zip(indices[0], distances[0]):
            record_id = list(self.metadata.keys())[idx]
            results.append({
                "record_id": record_id,
                "similarity": 1 / (1 + distance),  # Convert distance to similarity
                "metadata": self.metadata[record_id]
            })

        return results

# Usage Example:
vector_store = VectorStore()

# Index a community profile
vector_store.index_record(
    record_id=f"community_{community.id}",
    text=f"{community.community_names} {community.primary_ethnolinguistic_group} {community.needs_summary}",
    metadata={
        "type": "community",
        "id": community.id,
        "region": community.region.name
    }
)

# Search
results = vector_store.search("Tausug communities with health needs")
# Returns: Top 10 most relevant communities
```

**Indexing Strategy:**
- **Nightly batch job**: Index all new/updated records
- **Incremental updates**: Index immediately on create/update (async)
- **Index structure**:
  - Communities: Profile text + needs
  - Assessments: Questions + responses + findings
  - Policies: Title + description + recommendations
  - Engagements: Meeting notes + outcomes
  - PPAs: Title + description + impact

### 3.4 ML Model Pipeline

**Training Pipeline:**

```python
# src/ai_assistant/ml/training/needs_classifier.py
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
import joblib

class NeedsClassifier:
    """Multi-label classifier for community needs."""

    CATEGORIES = [
        'health', 'education', 'infrastructure',
        'livelihood', 'social_services', 'cultural_preservation'
    ]

    def __init__(self):
        self.vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
        self.classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)

    def train(self, training_data: List[Dict]):
        """Train classifier on historical assessment data."""

        # Prepare training data
        texts = [d['assessment_text'] for d in training_data]
        labels = [d['identified_needs'] for d in training_data]

        # Vectorize text
        X = self.vectorizer.fit_transform(texts)

        # Train classifier
        self.classifier.fit(X, labels)

        # Save model
        joblib.dump(self.vectorizer, 'models/vectorizer.pkl')
        joblib.dump(self.classifier, 'models/needs_classifier.pkl')

        # Log metrics
        accuracy = self.classifier.score(X, labels)
        logger.info(f"Model trained with accuracy: {accuracy:.2%}")

    def predict(self, assessment_text: str) -> List[Dict]:
        """Predict needs from assessment text."""
        X = self.vectorizer.transform([assessment_text])
        probabilities = self.classifier.predict_proba(X)[0]

        predictions = []
        for category, prob in zip(self.CATEGORIES, probabilities):
            if prob > 0.3:  # Threshold for inclusion
                predictions.append({
                    "category": category,
                    "confidence": float(prob)
                })

        return sorted(predictions, key=lambda x: x['confidence'], reverse=True)

# Celery Task for Monthly Retraining
@shared_task
def retrain_needs_classifier():
    """Retrain classifier with latest assessment data."""
    training_data = get_training_data_from_assessments()
    classifier = NeedsClassifier()
    classifier.train(training_data)
    logger.info("Needs classifier retrained successfully")
```

---

### 3.5 Caching Strategy

**Redis Caching for Cost Optimization:**

```python
# AI responses are expensive - aggressive caching is critical

CACHE_STRATEGIES = {
    'ai_analysis': {
        'ttl': 86400,  # 24 hours
        'key_pattern': 'ai_analysis_{assessment_id}',
        'invalidate_on': ['assessment_update', 'new_response']
    },
    'ai_report': {
        'ttl': 604800,  # 7 days
        'key_pattern': 'ai_report_{assessment_id}_{report_type}',
        'invalidate_on': ['assessment_complete']
    },
    'semantic_search': {
        'ttl': 3600,  # 1 hour
        'key_pattern': 'search_{query_hash}',
        'invalidate_on': ['content_update']
    },
    'embeddings': {
        'ttl': 2592000,  # 30 days (embeddings rarely change)
        'key_pattern': 'embedding_{content_hash}',
        'invalidate_on': ['never']  # Only invalidate on content change
    }
}

# Implementation
from django.core.cache import cache

def get_ai_analysis(assessment_id: int) -> dict:
    """Get AI analysis with caching."""
    cache_key = f'ai_analysis_{assessment_id}'

    if cached := cache.get(cache_key):
        logger.info(f"Cache HIT: {cache_key}")
        return cached

    logger.info(f"Cache MISS: {cache_key} - calling AI")
    analysis = claude_service.analyze_assessment(assessment_id)
    cache.set(cache_key, analysis, 86400)

    return analysis
```

**Cost Savings:**
- Cache hit ratio target: 80%
- Estimated cost reduction: 80% of AI API calls
- Example: 1000 analysis requests/day → 200 API calls (800 cached)

---

### 3.6 API Design

def analyze_assessment(request):
    """AI-powered assessment analysis."""
    assessment_id = request.data.get('assessment_id')

    analysis = get_ai_analysis(assessment_id)

    return Response({
        "success": True,
        "analysis": analysis,
        "cached": analysis.get('cached', False)
    })

@api_view(['POST'])
def generate_report(request):
    """Generate AI report (async)."""
    assessment_id = request.data.get('assessment_id')
    report_type = request.data.get('report_type', 'comprehensive')

    # Trigger async task
    task = generate_mana_report.delay(assessment_id, report_type)

    return Response({
        "success": True,
        "task_id": task.id,
        "status_url": f"/api/ai/task-status/{task.id}/"
    })

@api_view(['GET'])
def semantic_search(request):
    """Semantic search across all modules."""
    query = request.GET.get('q')
    modules = request.GET.getlist('module')  # Filter by module

    results = vector_store.search(query, k=20)

    if modules:
        results = [r for r in results if r['metadata']['type'] in modules]

    return Response({
        "query": query,
        "results": results[:10],
        "total": len(results)
    })

@api_view(['POST'])
def chat(request):
    """Conversational AI endpoint."""
    user_message = request.data.get('message')
    conversation_id = request.data.get('conversation_id')

    # Get or create conversation
    conversation = get_or_create_conversation(request.user, conversation_id)

    # Generate AI response with RAG
    response = claude_service.generate_chat_response(
        user_message=user_message,
        conversation_history=conversation.messages,
        context_retrieval=True  # Enable RAG
    )

    # Save messages
    conversation.add_message('user', user_message)
    conversation.add_message('assistant', response['text'])

    return Response({
        "message": response['text'],
        "conversation_id": str(conversation.id),
        "sources": response.get('sources', [])  # Citations from RAG
    })
```

---

#### AFTER AI (Automated Evidence Synthesis)

**Scenario:** Same policy development need.

**Steps:**
1. **AI Evidence Retrieval (Automatic - 5 minutes)**
   ```python
   # Policy Analyst uses conversational AI
   User: "I need to develop a policy for education access in Bangsamoro
          communities. Gather all relevant evidence."

   AI: "I'll search across all modules for education-related evidence.
        One moment..."

   # AI Process:
   # 1. Semantic search across vector DB (query: "education access Bangsamoro")
   # 2. Retrieve from MANA: 67 assessments mentioning education needs
   # 3. Retrieve from Coordination: 23 education partnerships
   # 4. Retrieve from M&E: 15 completed education PPAs with outcomes
   # 5. Retrieve from Communities: 145 profiles with education data
   # 6. Rank by relevance

   AI: "Found comprehensive evidence:
        - 67 MANA assessments (2022-2024)
        - 23 education partnerships (12 successful, 11 ongoing)
        - 15 completed PPAs with impact data
        - 145 community profiles with education metrics

        Top findings:
        1. 76% of communities lack integrated Madrasah-public school programs
        2. Arabic language instruction available in only 23% of communities
        3. Successful model: DepEd-Madrasah partnership in Region IX (serving 1,200 students)

        Would you like me to generate a policy draft?"
   ```

2. **AI Policy Generation (3 minutes)**
   ```python
   User: "Yes, generate a comprehensive policy recommendation."

   # AI Process:
   # 1. Analyze evidence and identify policy options
   # 2. Build causal model (similar interventions → outcomes)
   # 3. Apply cultural context (Madrasah integration, Islamic values)
   # 4. Generate policy structure:
   #    - Problem statement (evidence-based)
   #    - Proposed solution (based on successful models)
   #    - Implementation plan (informed by coordination data)
   #    - Budget estimate (based on similar PPAs)
   #    - Cultural considerations (automatic validation)
   # 5. Create policy document with citations

   AI: "Policy recommendation generated:
        'Integrated Madrasah-Public School Education Program'

        Evidence base: 67 assessments, 23 partnerships, 15 projects
        Expected beneficiaries: 3,500 students across 18 communities
        Budget estimate: ₱12.5M (based on 3 similar successful PPAs)
        Implementation partners: DepEd, MBHTE, 5 LGUs
        Cultural validation: ✅ Shariah-compatible, community consultations completed

        Download: [15-page policy brief with full evidence citations]"
   ```

3. **Human Review & Refinement (4 hours)**
   - Review AI-generated policy (comprehensive, evidence-rich)
   - Add strategic context and political considerations
   - Refine recommendations based on current priorities
   - Validate cultural appropriateness (already checked by AI)
   - Finalize

**Total Time:** 4.5 hours (same day)
**Evidence Coverage:** Comprehensive (AI searched all modules, found connections)
**Time Saved:** 83.5 hours (95% reduction)
**Quality Improvement:** More evidence, better citations, cultural validation automatic

   - Contact 5-10 NGOs by email/phone
   - Explain project requirements
   - Request proposals

4. **Decision Making (2 hours)**
   - Compare proposals
   - Check references
   - Make final selection

**Total Time:** 14 hours over 3 days
**Result:** 1-2 suitable partners found
**Risk:** May miss better-fit NGOs, no data on success prediction

---

#### AFTER AI (Intelligent Matching)

**Scenario:** Same need - livelihood project for Sama-Bajau fishing community.

**Steps:**
1. **AI-Powered Matching (Instant - 30 seconds)**
   ```python

       "project_type": "livelihood",
       "sector": "fishing",
       "budget": 500000
   }

   # AI Process:
   # 1. Embed community needs as vector
   # 2. Embed all NGO capabilities as vectors (from historical data)
   # 3. Calculate similarity scores
   # 4. Filter by: geographic coverage, budget range, sector expertise
   # 5. Analyze past partnership success (ML model)
   # 6. Rank by overall match score

## 6. Responsible AI Framework

### 6.1 Cultural Sensitivity & Bias Mitigation

**Bangsamoro-Specific Safeguards:**

```python

    def __init__(self):
        self.context = BangsomoroCulturalContext()
        self.prohibited_terms = [

                })

        return {
            "is_valid": len([i for i in issues if i['severity'] == 'critical']) == 0,
            "issues": issues,
            "cultural_score": max(0, 10 - len(issues) * 2)

        validation_result=validation,
        is_approved=validation['is_valid']
    )

    return response
```

**Bias Detection Metrics:**
- **Demographic Equity**: Ensure AI recommendations don't favor specific ethnolinguistic groups
- **Geographic Fairness**: Balance attention across regions (IX, X, XI, XII)
- **Resource Allocation**: Detect if AI systematically under/over-allocates to certain communities
- **Language Bias**: Ensure multilingual support (Filipino, English, Arabic, Bangsamoro languages)

**Testing Protocol:**
```python
# Monthly Bias Audit
@shared_task
def run_bias_audit():
    """Audit AI outputs for demographic and geographic bias."""

    # Test dataset: Equal representation of all ethnolinguistic groups
    test_cases = generate_balanced_test_cases()

    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        ai_output = claude_service.analyze_community(case)

            "needs_identified": ai_output['needs'],
            "priority_score": ai_output['priority']
        })

    # Statistical analysis
    bias_report = analyze_bias(results)

    if bias_report['bias_detected']:
        logger.critical(f"AI BIAS DETECTED: {bias_report['details']}")
        notify_admins(bias_report)
        # Trigger model retraining with balanced dataset
        retrain_model.delay(balanced=True)
```

---

### 6.2 Privacy & Data Security

**Data Handling Principles:**

1. **Community Data Sovereignty**
   - Communities own their data (not OOBC or AI providers)
   - Explicit consent required for AI processing
   - Right to deletion extends to AI embeddings and models

2. **Data Minimization**
   ```python
   # Only send necessary data to AI APIs
   def prepare_ai_input(assessment: Assessment) -> str:
       """Prepare assessment data for AI (PII removed)."""
       return {
           "community_type": assessment.community.primary_ethnolinguistic_group,
           "region": assessment.region.name,
           "responses": anonymize_responses(assessment.responses),  # Names removed
           "needs": assessment.needs_summary
       }
       # DON'T send: participant names, contact info, exact addresses
   ```

3. **API Security**
   - Anthropic Claude: SOC 2 Type II certified, GDPR compliant
   - Data not used for training (Anthropic policy)
   - In-transit encryption (HTTPS/TLS 1.3)
   - API key rotation every 90 days

4. **Local Processing Preference**
   ```python
   # Prefer local ML models over API calls when possible

   # LOW RISK: Use local model (no data leaves server)
   needs = local_classifier.predict(assessment_text)

   # HIGH RISK: Use API only when necessary (anonymized data)
   if needs_complex_reasoning:
       analysis = claude_service.analyze(anonymized_data)
   ```

5. **Audit Logging**
   ```python
   # Log all AI operations
   class AIAuditLog(models.Model):
       timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
       user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
       operation = models.CharField(max_length=100)  # "analyze_assessment", "generate_report"
       data_sent = models.JSONField()  # Anonymized summary of data sent to AI
       ai_provider = models.CharField(max_length=50)  # "claude", "local_model"
       response_summary = models.TextField()
       data_classification = models.CharField(max_length=20)  # "public", "sensitive", "confidential"
   ```

---

### 6.3 Transparency & Explainability

**AI Disclosure Requirements:**

1. **Always Indicate AI-Generated Content**
   ```html
   <!-- All AI-generated content must be labeled -->
   <div class="ai-generated-content">
       <div class="ai-badge">
           <i class="fas fa-robot"></i>
           AI-Generated Content
           <span class="model-info">Claude Sonnet 4 | Confidence: 87%</span>
       </div>
       <p>{{ ai_content }}</p>
   </div>
   ```

2. **Provide Explanations**
   ```python
   # AI must explain its reasoning
   def analyze_with_explanation(assessment_id: int) -> dict:
       """Analyze assessment with explainable AI."""

       analysis = claude_service.analyze(assessment_id)

       return {
           "findings": analysis['findings'],
           "explanation": analysis['reasoning'],  # Why AI reached these conclusions
           "confidence": analysis['confidence'],  # 0-100%
           "evidence": analysis['citations'],  # Source data references
           "limitations": analysis['caveats']  # What AI might have missed
       }
   ```

3. **Human-in-the-Loop for Critical Decisions**
   - AI recommendations require human approval before implementation
   - Budget allocations >₱1M must be human-validated
   - Policy recommendations reviewed by subject matter experts
   - Community-affecting decisions require community consultation (AI assists, not decides)

4. **Explainable ML Models**
   ```python
   # Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability
   import shap

   def explain_prediction(model, input_data):
       """Explain why ML model made this prediction."""
       explainer = shap.TreeExplainer(model)
       shap_values = explainer.shap_values(input_data)

       # Return top features influencing prediction
       feature_importance = sorted(
           zip(feature_names, shap_values[0]),
           key=lambda x: abs(x[1]),
           reverse=True
       )[:5]

       return {
           "prediction": model.predict(input_data)[0],
           "top_factors": [
               {"feature": name, "impact": float(value)}
               for name, value in feature_importance
           ]
       }
   ```

### 6.5 Ethical AI Guidelines

**Principles:**

1. **AI Augments, Not Replaces, Human Judgment**
   - AI provides insights, recommendations, and automation
   - Final decisions remain with human experts
   - Community consultation cannot be replaced by AI

2. **Transparency by Default**
   - All AI operations are logged and auditable
   - Users always know when they're interacting with AI
   - AI reasoning must be explainable

3. **Cultural Primacy**
   - Bangsamoro cultural values override AI efficiency
   - When AI conflicts with cultural norms, culture wins
   - AI must actively promote cultural preservation

4. **Community Benefit**
   - AI must demonstrably serve Bangsamoro communities
   - No AI use case that doesn't directly benefit OOBC mission
