## Next Steps

**Immediate Actions (This Week):**
1. [x] ✅ Review comprehensive AI strategy
2. [x] ✅ Get stakeholder approval (via implementation)
3. [x] ✅ Secure budget allocation (Gemini API key obtained)
4. [x] ✅ Obtain API keys (GOOGLE_API_KEY configured)
5. [x] ✅ Set up development environment

**Phase 1 Completed:**
1. [x] ✅ Team assembly (AI Engineer agents deployed)
2. [x] ✅ Infrastructure setup complete (Gemini + Redis + FAISS)
3. [x] ✅ Communities module AI features implemented
4. [x] ✅ MANA module AI features implemented

**Deployment Sprint (Ready to Execute):**
1. [ ] ⬜ Run `./scripts/deploy_ai.sh` (automated deployment)
2. [ ] ⬜ Configure GOOGLE_API_KEY in .env
3. [ ] ⬜ Run `./scripts/verify_ai.sh` (verification)
4. [ ] ⬜ Start services (Django, Redis, Celery worker, Celery beat)
5. [ ] ⬜ Index existing data (`python manage.py index_communities`)
6. [ ] ⬜ User acceptance testing (use docs/testing/AI_USER_ACCEPTANCE_TESTING.md)
7. [ ] ⬜ Monitor AI quality and costs (AIOperation admin panel)
8. [ ] ⬜ Production deployment (follow docs/deployment/AI_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
