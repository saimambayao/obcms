# OBCMS Query Template Expansion - Implementation Roadmap

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Date**: January 2025
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Target**: Expand from 151 to 575 templates (281% increase)

## Executive Summary

This roadmap provides a comprehensive, phased approach to expanding OBCMS's query template system from **151 to 575 templates** over **8 weeks**. The expansion introduces **5 new query categories** (Geographic, Temporal, Cross-Domain, Analytics, Comparison) while enhancing existing domains with **234 additional templates**.

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Current | Target | Change |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| Total Templates | 151 | 575 | +424 (+281%) |
| Categories | 7 | 12 | +5 (+71%) |
| Performance | <10ms | <10ms | Maintained |
| Cost | $0 | $0 | Zero AI cost |
| Coverage | 60% | 95% | +35% |

### Strategic Value

- **Enhanced Decision Making**: Cross-domain queries enable evidence-based policy decisions
- **Geographic Intelligence**: Complete administrative hierarchy queries (Region → Barangay)
- **Temporal Analytics**: Trend analysis and historical comparisons for program monitoring
- **Zero Operational Cost**: Pure pattern-matching maintains $0 AI API costs
- **Sub-10ms Performance**: Optimizations ensure speed at 3× scale

**Impact**: HIGH
**Mitigation**:
- Implement lazy loading (70% startup time reduction)
- Use trie-based indexing (90% search space reduction)
- Add multi-level caching (80% cache hit rate)
- Continuous benchmarking with rollback threshold

**Rollback Plan**: If P95 latency exceeds 15ms, roll back to previous phase

#### 2. Template Conflicts/Ambiguity

**Risk**: New patterns conflict with existing templates
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**:
- Implement validation layer to catch conflicts

**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**:
- Optimize Django ORM queries (select_related, prefetch_related)
- Implement query result caching
- Limit result sets (pagination)
- Database indexing for foreign keys

**Monitoring**: Track cross-domain query performance separately

### Medium-Risk Areas

#### 5. Test Coverage Gaps

**Risk**: New templates lack comprehensive tests
**Likelihood**: MEDIUM
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**:
- Enforce 100% coverage requirement
- Automated test generation
- Test review in code review process

### Low-Risk Areas

#### 6. User Adoption

**Risk**: Users don't know about new query capabilities
**Likelihood**: LOW
**Impact**: MEDIUM
**Mitigation**:
- User guide with examples
