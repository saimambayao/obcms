## Query Tips

### 1. Use Natural Language

The system understands variations. All these work:
```
"How many communities?"
"Count communities"
"Total communities"
"Number of communities"
```

### 2. Be Specific When Possible

More specific queries give better results:
```
❌ "Show communities"
✅ "Show communities in Region IX"

❌ "Show needs"
✅ "Show critical infrastructure needs in Cotabato"
```

### 3. Use Keywords

These keywords trigger specific query types:
- **Count/How many:** Returns a number
- **Show/List/Display:** Returns a list
- **Compare:** Returns comparison results
- **Trends/Over time:** Returns temporal analysis
- **Without/Lacking/Gap:** Returns gap analysis

### 4. Date Formats

The system understands various date formats:
```
"Last 30 days"
"This month"
"This quarter"
"This fiscal year"
"YTD" (Year-to-date)
"2024 vs 2023"
```

### 5. Location Names

Use full names for best results:
```
✅ "Region IX" (not "IX" alone)
✅ "Zamboanga del Sur" (not "ZDS")
✅ "Cotabato City" (not "Cotabato")
```

### 6. Multi-Entity Queries

Combine multiple filters:
```
"Critical infrastructure needs in Region IX"
"High-priority education needs without PPAs"
"Active partnerships in Zamboanga Peninsula"
```

```

### Performance Monitoring

**Trends:**
```

## Troubleshooting

### Query Not Matching

**Symptoms:**
- Response: "I don't understand that query"
- Response: "No matching template found"

**Solutions:**
1. Simplify your query
2. Use keywords (count, show, list)
3. Check spelling
4. Try alternative phrasing
5. Ask for help: "What can you do?"

**Example:**
```
❌ "Gimme dem communities yo"
✅ "Show me all communities"
```

### No Results Returned

**Symptoms:**
- Query matches but returns empty list
- Response: "No results found"

**Possible Reasons:**
1. No data exists (e.g., no communities in that region)
2. Filters too restrictive
3. Status filter excludes all results

**Solutions:**
1. Broaden your query (remove filters)
2. Check data exists in system
3. Try different filters

**Example:**
```
❌ "Critical needs in Antarctica" (no data)
✅ "Critical needs in Region IX" (has data)
```

### Slow Response

**Symptoms:**
- Query takes >2 seconds
- Loading indicator shows for long time

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Complex cross-domain query (multiple joins)
2. Large dataset (thousands of results)
3. Server under heavy load

**Solutions:**
1. Wait for query to complete (may take up to 5 seconds)
2. Simplify query (fewer filters)
3. Try again during off-peak hours
4. Contact support if consistently slow

### Wrong Results

**Symptoms:**
- Results don't match expectation
- Wrong data returned

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Query matched wrong template
2. Ambiguous query (multiple interpretations)
3. Data quality issues

**Solutions:**
1. Be more specific in your query
2. Use exact names (locations, sectors, etc.)
3. Check data in system is correct
4. Report issue to support

Combine multiple filters in one query:
```
"Critical infrastructure needs in Region IX identified last 30 days"

Entities extracted:
- Priority: Critical
- Sector: Infrastructure
- Location: Region IX

```

### 2. Temporal Analysis

Track changes over time:
```
"Assessment completion trends"
→ Shows monthly completion rates with trend line

"2024 vs 2023 comparison"
→ Shows side-by-side comparison with % change
```

### 3. Cross-Domain Intelligence

Link data across modules:
```
"Complete flow: Needs to Policies to PPAs"
→ Shows full evidence-based budgeting pipeline
→ Identifies gaps at each stage
```

### 4. Gap Analysis

Find what's missing:
```
"Needs without PPAs"
→ Lists needs lacking implementation projects
→ Prioritized by urgency and impact

"Communities never assessed"
→ Lists unassessed communities
→ Prioritized by population and location
```

### 5. Predictive Insights
