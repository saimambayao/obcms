## Problem Statement

## Solution Summary

### What Was Fixed

1. **âœ… Gemini Fallback Mechanism** - Added conversational AI fallback
2. **âœ… Location Entity Extraction** - Enhanced to recognize cities

4. **âœ… Entity Recognition** - Extended to include geographic locations
5. **âœ… Help Responses** - Improved structure and examples
6. **âœ… Model Import Paths** - Corrected incorrect model references

### Result

Instead of errors, users now get helpful, contextual responses:

> "That's a wonderful question! Davao City is home to significant and diverse Bangsamoro communities, particularly Maranao, Maguindanao, and Tausug groups. The OBCMS maintains community profiles and MANA reports detailing their demographics and priority needs..."
