## Current Issues

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Gemini API Quota Exhausted

**Error:** `429 You exceeded your current quota`

**Impact:**
- All data queries failing ("How many communities in Region IX?")
- Conversational AI unavailable
- Users see generic error message

**Cause:**
- Free tier limit: 250 requests/day
- Quota exhausted from testing
- Resets in ~24 hours

**Solutions:**
1. **Upgrade API** (paid tier: 1,000 req/min, ~$24/month) ‚Üê RECOMMENDED
2. **Implement fallback** (local database queries for common patterns)
3. **Wait 24 hours** (testing only, not production-ready)

**See:** [Troubleshooting Guide](TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md)

## What's Working ‚úÖ

### 1. Chat Interface
- Widget loads correctly
- Messages send/receive
- UI responsive and accessible
- Error states display properly

### 2. CSRF Protection
- Tokens properly included in POST requests
- Console verification: "‚úÖ CSRF token added to POST request"
- No more 403 Forbidden errors

### 3. Help System
- "help" command works without API
- Lists available capabilities
- Provides guidance to users

### 4. Database Integration
- Conversations stored in database
- Message history preserved
- Query results cached
- Session management working

## What's Broken ‚ùå

### 1. AI-Powered Queries
- "How many communities in Region IX?" ‚Üí Fails
- "List all assessments" ‚Üí Fails
- Any natural language query ‚Üí Fails

**Reason:** Gemini API quota exhausted

### 2. Conversational Responses
- Follow-up questions ‚Üí Fails
- Context-aware responses ‚Üí Fails
- Natural language generation ‚Üí Fails

**Reason:** Same API quota issue

## Testing Status

### Manual Tests Completed

‚úÖ **Test 1: CSRF Token**
```bash
# Browser console shows:
‚úÖ CSRF token added to POST request

# Network tab shows:
Request Headers: X-CSRFToken: <valid-token>
Response: 200 OK
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Test 2: Data Query**
```bash
Query: "How many communities are in Region IX?"
Expected: "There are X communities in Region IX."
Actual: "I couldn't process your question. Please try rephrasing it."
Error: 429 Quota Exceeded
```

‚úÖ **Test 3: Help Command**
```bash
Query: "help"
Response: [Lists available commands]
Status: WORKING (no API needed)
```

## Immediate Next Steps

### Option A: Production Deployment (RECOMMENDED)
1. Upgrade Gemini API to paid tier
2. Generate new API key
3. Update `.env` with `GEMINI_API_KEY=<new-key>`
4. Restart server
5. Test all queries
6. Deploy to staging

**Timeline:** 30 minutes
**Cost:** ~$24/month

---

### Option B: Local Fallback (TEMPORARY)
1. Implement pattern matching for common queries
2. Add database query fallbacks
3. Test with predefined patterns
4. Document limitations

**Timeline:** 2-3 hours
**Cost:** $0 (but limited functionality)
