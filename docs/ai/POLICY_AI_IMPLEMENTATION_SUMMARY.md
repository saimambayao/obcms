```json
{
  "synthesis": "Evidence from 23 sources shows strong need for healthcare access...",
  "key_findings": [
    "65% of coastal communities lack basic healthcare facilities",
    "Average travel time to nearest clinic: 2.5 hours",
    "High prevalence of preventable diseases"
  ],
  "data_gaps": [
    "Limited data on maternal health outcomes",
    "No baseline for chronic disease prevalence"
  ],
  "strength_of_evidence": "strong",
  "confidence_score": 0.85
}
```

### Generated Policy Example
```json
{
  "title": "Expanding Healthcare Access for Coastal Bangsamoro Communities",
  "executive_summary": "This policy aims to establish mobile health clinics...",
  "problem_statement": "65% of coastal Bangsamoro communities lack...",
  "estimated_cost": 5000000,
  "citations": 23,
  "generated_by_ai": true,
  "evidence_strength": "strong"
}
```
