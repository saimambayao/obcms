**Issue:** Synchronous AI calls risk timeouts
**Impact:** Critical for production stability
**Effort:** 4-6 hours
**Deadline:** Before deployment

### 🔴 Priority 2: HIGH - Create AI Monitoring Dashboard
**Issue:** No real-time visibility into AI health, costs, performance
**Impact:** Critical for production operations
**Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Deadline:** Within 1 week of deployment

### 🟡 Priority 3: MEDIUM - Standardize Error Handling
**Issue:** Inconsistent error patterns across modules
**Impact:** Improves reliability and debugging
**Effort:** 6-8 hours
**Deadline:** Within 2 weeks

### 🟡 Priority 4: MEDIUM - Optimize Prompt Engineering
**Issue:** Large prompts increase costs by 30-40%
**Impact:** 40% cost reduction ($4-6/month savings per 100 users)
**Effort:** 8-10 hours
**Deadline:** Within 1 month

### 🟢 Priority 5: LOW - Standardize MANA to GeminiService
**Issue:** MANA uses legacy wrapper, others use GeminiService
