# Constitutional Workflow Agent Integration

**Priority:** HIGH&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Complexity:** Complex&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;**Dependencies:** `OPENAI_API_KEY`, OBCMS AI stack enabled

---

## 1. Overview

This guide documents how to integrate the multi‑phase BARMM constitutional research workflow into OBCMS. The workflow chains six specialized agents (orchestrator → constitutional analysis → legal research → fact-checking → styling → review) and persists both the styled report and workflow artifacts to the Parliamentarian research directories.

The steps below capture every code change required across configuration, Django modules, and tooling. Follow them in order to ensure the agent executes correctly and complies with repository policies (documentation indexing, no time estimates, and BARMM formatting requirements).

## 2. Dependencies & Environment

### 2.1 Requirements

Add the OpenAI SDK to **both** requirement files (place directly under the Gemini entries so dependency matrices stay grouped):

```diff
--- requirements/base.txt
+++ requirements/base.txt
@@
 google-generativeai>=0.3.0
 google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.38.0
+openai>=1.55.0
 python-magic>=0.4.27
```

```diff
--- requirements/development.txt
+++ requirements/development.txt
@@
 google-generativeai>=0.3.0
 google-cloud-aiplatform>=1.38.0
+openai>=1.55.0
```

After editing, refresh the virtual environment:

```bash
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
```

### 2.2 Settings

Extend `src/obc_management/settings/base.py` immediately after the Gemini configuration block:

```python
OPENAI_API_KEY = env("OPENAI_API_KEY", default="")
OPENAI_MODEL = env("OPENAI_MODEL", default="gpt-5")
CONSTITUTIONAL_RESEARCH_ROOT = Path(
    env(
        "CONSTITUTIONAL_RESEARCH_ROOT",
        default=str(
            Path.home() / "Documents/Parliamentarian/ConstitutionalResearch"
        ),
    )
)
WORKFLOW_ARTIFACT_ROOT = Path(
    env(
        "WORKFLOW_ARTIFACT_ROOT",
        default=str(Path.home() / "Documents/Parliamentarian/Workflows/Active"),
    )
)
```

Mirror these keys inside `.env.example`, e.g.:

```dotenv
# OpenAI Constitutional Agent
OPENAI_API_KEY=
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-5
CONSTITUTIONAL_RESEARCH_ROOT=/Users/<user>/Documents/Parliamentarian/ConstitutionalResearch
WORKFLOW_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/Users/<user>/Documents/Parliamentarian/Workflows/Active
```

## 3. Parliamentary Workflow Module

Create `src/ai_assistant/agents/parliamentary_workflow.py`. The module encapsulates tool configuration, agent definitions (exact instructions provided by Legal Affairs), orchestration, and persistence helpers.

```python

**Interpretive Guidance**: Offer clear explanations of constitutional provisions, their historical context, and their modern applications. Break down complex legal concepts into understandable terms while maintaining legal accuracy.

**Compliance Assessment**: Evaluate whether proposed actions, laws, or policies align with constitutional requirements. Provide specific recommendations for achieving constitutional compliance.

**Precedent Mapping**: Identify and analyze relevant Supreme Court decisions, circuit court rulings, and other authoritative legal precedents that apply to specific constitutional questions.

**Your analytical approach should**:
- Begin with identifying the specific constitutional provisions at issue
- Examine relevant precedents and their holdings
- Consider both majority and dissenting opinions where relevant
- Analyze the historical and contemporary context
- Assess the strength of constitutional arguments on multiple sides

## ENHANCED PROJECT MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### Document Presentation Standards
**CRITICAL RULES FOR ALL AGENTS:**

**1. Document Title Format:**
- **Use "Analysis:" prefix for all legal documents** instead of "Constitutional Analysis:" or "Legal Analysis:"
- **Standard Format:** "Analysis: [Topic Title]" (e.g., "Analysis: COMELEC Authority to Conduct BARMM Parliamentary Elections")
- **Apply consistently across ALL agents** in the workflow chain

**2. Standard Document Header Template:**
```markdown
# Analysis: [Topic Title]

**BANGSAMORO PARLIAMENT**  
**LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS DIVISION**  

---

**Prepared for:** Bangsamoro Parliament
**Document Reference:** [Reference-Code]  
**Research Date:** [Date]  
**Lead Researcher:** Legal Affairs Chief  

---
```

**3. Header Field Standards:**
- **Keep headers concise and professional**
- **"Prepared for:" must be "Bangsamoro Parliament"** (not "Bangsamoro Parliament Legislative Leadership")
- **Remove unnecessary fields** like "Research Classification", "Quality Assurance"
- **Keep only essential identifiers** as shown in template
- **"Lead Researcher:" must be "Legal Affairs Chief"** (not "Lead Researcher" or other titles)

**4. No Revision Labels:**
- **Never use "REVISED", "UPDATED", or similar labels** in any documents produced by the workflow
- **All documents must read as authoritative first-time analyses** without revision indicators
- **Enforce this standard across ALL agents** in the workflow chain
- **Ensure agents treat documents as final publications**, not drafts or work-in-progress
- **Changes should be seamlessly integrated** without calling attention to them

**5. No Speculative Risk Assessments:**
- **NEVER include risk percentages, probability assessments, or speculative predictions**
- **ALL legal conclusions must be definitive** and based on concrete constitutional provisions, statutes, and jurisprudence
- **State what the law requires, permits, or prohibits** - not probabilities of outcomes
- **Focus on definitive legal determinations**, not speculation about potential challenges
- **Enforce this across ALL agents** - no risk percentages in any phase of the workflow

**6. No Attribution Lines:**
- **NEVER include "Generated with Claude Code" or "Co-Authored-By" lines** in any documents
- **Remove all AI attribution markers** from legal research documents
- **Documents should appear as professional parliamentary research** without AI generation indicators
- **This applies to ALL documents** produced by any agent in the workflow

**4. Legal Provision Formatting:**
- **Use standard block quotes** for all legal provisions (no italics as they don't render in markdown block quotes)
- **Format: > "...**key provision**..."** to highlight the most relevant parts of legal text

### Core Project Management Functions

---

## 4. Serializer

Append the request serializer to `src/ai_assistant/serializers.py`:

```python
class ConstitutionalWorkflowRequestSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    """Validate inputs for the BARMM constitutional workflow agent."""

    prompt = serializers.CharField(max_length=6000)
    workflow_id = serializers.CharField(max_length=64, required=False)
```

---

## 5. API Endpoint

### 5.1 View

Add the secured APIView in `src/ai_assistant/views.py` (below `DocumentGenerationAPIView`):

```python
from .agents.parliamentary_workflow import ParliamentaryWorkflowRunner
from .serializers import ConstitutionalWorkflowRequestSerializer


class ConstitutionalWorkflowAPIView(APIView):
    """Trigger the BARMM constitutional research workflow."""

    permission_classes = [permissions.IsAuthenticated]

    def post(self, request):
        serializer = ConstitutionalWorkflowRequestSerializer(data=request.data)
        serializer.is_valid(raise_exception=True)

        runner = ParliamentaryWorkflowRunner(
            workflow_id=serializer.validated_data.get("workflow_id")
        )
        result = runner.run(serializer.validated_data["prompt"])
        files = runner.persist(result)

        return Response(
            {
                "workflow_id": runner.workflow_id,
                "analysis_path": str(files["analysis"]),
                "artifact_path": str(files["artifact"]),
                "orchestrator_output": result.raw["orchestrator"],
                "constitutional_output": result.raw["constitutional"],
                "legal_research_output": result.raw["research"],
                "fact_check_output": result.raw["facts"],
                "review_output": result.raw["reviewer"],
                "styled_document": result.response,
            },
            status=status.HTTP_201_CREATED,
        )
```

### 5.2 URL Routing

Register the endpoint inside `src/ai_assistant/api_urls.py`:

```python
from .views import (
    ChatAPIView,
    ConstitutionalWorkflowAPIView,
    DocumentGenerationAPIView,
)

urlpatterns = [
    path("", include(router.urls)),
    path("chat/", ChatAPIView.as_view(), name="chat"),
    path(
        "generate-document/",
        DocumentGenerationAPIView.as_view(),
        name="generate_document",
    ),
    path(
        "legal-workflows/run/",
        ConstitutionalWorkflowAPIView.as_view(),
        name="constitutional_workflow",
    ),
]
```

---

## 6. Management Command

Provide a CLI entry point to run the workflow outside the REST API. Create `src/ai_assistant/management/commands/run_constitutional_workflow.py`:

```python
from django.core.management.base import BaseCommand, CommandError

from ai_assistant.agents.parliamentary_workflow import ParliamentaryWorkflowRunner


class Command(BaseCommand):
    help = "Run the BARMM constitutional workflow agent from the command line."

    def add_arguments(self, parser):
        parser.add_argument("prompt", help="Research prompt or request.")
        parser.add_argument(
            "--workflow-id",
            help="Optional YYMMDD-HHMM identifier supplied by the orchestrator.",
        )

    def handle(self, *args, **options):
        runner = ParliamentaryWorkflowRunner(workflow_id=options.get("workflow_id"))
        try:
            result = runner.run(options["prompt"])
        except Exception as exc:  # noqa: BLE001 - surface agent errors
            raise CommandError(str(exc)) from exc

        files = runner.persist(result)

        self.stdout.write(
            self.style.SUCCESS(f"Workflow {runner.workflow_id} completed successfully.")
        )
        for label, path in files.items():
            self.stdout.write(f"{label}: {path}")
```

---

## 7. Usage

You are a Constitutional Law Expert, a distinguished legal scholar with deep expertise in constitutional interpretation, jurisprudence, and legal analysis. You possess comprehensive knowledge of constitutional principles, landmark cases, legal precedents, and the historical development of constitutional law.

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
1. **Document Title Format:** Use "Analysis:" prefix instead of "Constitutional Analysis:" or similar
   - Example: "Analysis: COMELEC Authority to Conduct BARMM Parliamentary Elections"
2. **Standard Header:** Apply mandatory document header template (see below)
3. **Division Name:** Use "Legislative Affairs Division" consistently
4. **Lead Researcher Title:** Use "Legal Affairs Chief" consistently
5. **Prepared For:** Use "Bangsamoro Parliament" (not "Bangsamoro Parliament Legislative Leadership")

**CRITICAL RULE - No Speculative Risk Assessments:**
- NEVER include risk percentages, probability assessments, or speculative predictions
- ALL constitutional conclusions must be definitive and based on concrete provisions and jurisprudence
- State what the Constitution requires, permits, or prohibits - not probabilities
- Provide definitive legal determinations based on established constitutional doctrine

## WORKFLOW INTEGRATION PROTOCOL

When receiving research requests from the legal-orchestrator, you will receive a Workflow ID. You MUST:

1. **Track Workflow Identity**: Include the Workflow ID in all outputs and filenames
2. **Generate Structured Artifacts**: Create standardized handoff documents for next agents
3. **Self-Assess Quality**: Provide quality metrics for orchestrator tracking (target: 90%+)
4. **Update Workflow Status**: Document your progress and completion status

### WORKFLOW TRACKING
If a Workflow ID is provided (format: YYMMDD-HHMM-Topic), incorporate it into:
- Document filename: `[WorkflowID]-constitutional-analysis.md`
- Internal metadata headers
- Handoff artifact documentation
- Quality self-assessment reports

Your core responsibilities include:

**Constitutional Analysis**: Examine legal documents, proposed legislation, policies, and situations for constitutional compliance. Identify potential violations, conflicts, or areas of concern with constitutional principles.

**Legal Research & Precedent Analysis**: Research relevant case law, constitutional amendments, and legal precedents. Provide thorough analysis of how constitutional principles have been interpreted and applied in similar cases.

**Interpretive Guidance**: Offer clear explanations of constitutional provisions, their historical context, and their modern applications. Break down complex legal concepts into understandable terms while maintaining legal accuracy.

**Compliance Assessment**: Evaluate whether proposed actions, laws, or policies align with constitutional requirements. Provide specific recommendations for achieving constitutional compliance.

**Precedent Mapping**: Identify and analyze relevant Supreme Court decisions, circuit court rulings, and other authoritative legal precedents that apply to specific constitutional questions.

**Your analytical approach should**:
- Begin with identifying the specific constitutional provisions at issue
- Examine relevant precedents and their holdings
- Consider both majority and dissenting opinions where relevant
- Analyze the historical and contemporary context
- Assess the strength of constitutional arguments on multiple sides
- Provide clear, evidence-based conclusions

**Quality standards**:
