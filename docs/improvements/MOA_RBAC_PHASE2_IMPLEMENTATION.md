# MOA RBAC Phase 2 Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-08
**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Phase:** 2 of 2 (All MOA RBAC restrictions now implemented)

---

## Overview

Phase 2 completes the comprehensive MOA (Ministry/Office/Agency) Role-Based Access Control system by implementing filtering and access restrictions for:

1. **Policies, Programs, and Services** - Filtered by MOA organization
2. **PPA Access** - Strengthened with filtering in dashboards and detail views
3. **OOBC Initiatives** - Completely blocked for MOA users
4. **M&E Analytics** - Completely blocked for MOA users

Phase 1 (previously completed) implemented OBC forms view-only, geographic data blocking, and MOA profile restrictions.

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. New Decorators and Helper Functions

**File:** `src/common/utils/moa_permissions.py`

#### New Decorator: `@moa_can_edit_service`
```python
def moa_can_edit_service(view_func):
    """
    Decorator: Allow MOA users to edit their own MOA services only.

    Checks pk or service_id in URL kwargs.
    """
```

#### New Helper Functions:
```python
def user_can_access_policies(user):
    """Check if user can access policy recommendations."""
    # MOA users BLOCKED from policies - OOBC internal function

def user_can_access_oobc_initiatives(user):
    """Check if user can access OOBC initiatives."""
    # MOA users BLOCKED

def user_can_access_me_analytics(user):
    """Check if user can access M&E analytics."""
    # MOA users BLOCKED from strategic analytics
```

---

### 2. User Model Extensions

**File:** `src/common/models.py`

#### New Methods on `User` Model:
```python
def can_edit_service(self, service):
    """Check if user can edit the given service offering."""
    if self.is_superuser or self.is_oobc_staff:
        return True
    if self.is_moa_staff:
        return service.offering_mao == self.moa_organization
    return False

def can_view_service(self, service):
    """Check if user can view the given service offering."""
    if self.is_superuser or self.is_oobc_staff:
        return True
    if self.is_moa_staff:
        # Can view their own MOA's services
        return service.offering_mao == self.moa_organization
    return False
```

---

### 3. Policies and Programs Access Control

**Decision:** Since `PolicyRecommendation` model does NOT have a direct FK to Organization (only a `responsible_agencies` TextField), we implemented **complete blocking** of MOA access to policies.

**Rationale:**
- Policies are OOBC's strategic function, not MOA responsibility
- MOA users should not create or edit policies
- Programs are tracked as `PolicyRecommendation` with `recommendation_type='program'`
- Services have a proper FK (`offering_mao`), so those can be filtered

**Implementation:**
- Applied `@moa_no_access` decorator to all policy-related views
- MOA users attempting to access policies will receive:
  ```
  PermissionDenied: "MOA users do not have access to this module.
                     This is an OOBC internal function."
  ```

---

### 4. Services Access Control

**Model:** `ServiceOffering` (in `services.models`)

**Field:** `offering_mao` (FK to Organization)

#### Implementation Strategy:
- **List views:** Filter queryset to only show services where `offering_mao == user.moa_organization`
- **Detail views:** Check ownership with `@moa_can_edit_service` decorator
- **Edit/Delete views:** Apply `@moa_can_edit_service` decorator

**Note:** Service views implementation pending (no existing views found in current codebase). Decorators are ready for when service views are created.

---

### 5. PPA Access Restrictions (Strengthened)

**File:** `src/monitoring/views.py`

#### A. MOA PPAs Dashboard (`moa_ppas_dashboard`)
**Changes:**
```python
def moa_ppas_dashboard(request):
    all_moa_entries = _prefetch_entries().filter(category="moa_ppa")

    # MOA RBAC: Filter to only show their own MOA's PPAs
    if request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.is_moa_staff:
        if request.user.moa_organization:
            all_moa_entries = all_moa_entries.filter(
                implementing_moa=request.user.moa_organization
            )
        else:
            # MOA user with no organization assigned - show nothing
            all_moa_entries = all_moa_entries.none()
```

**Result:**
- MOA users ONLY see PPAs from their own MOA
- MOA users cannot see other MOAs' PPAs in the dashboard
- MOA users without an assigned organization see nothing

#### B. Monitoring Entry Detail (`monitoring_entry_detail`)
**Changes:**
```python
def monitoring_entry_detail(request, pk):
    entry = get_object_or_404(_prefetch_entries(), pk=pk)

    # MOA RBAC: Check if MOA user can access this PPA
    if request.user.is_authenticated and request.user.is_moa_staff:
        if entry.category == "moa_ppa":
            # MOA user can only view their own MOA's PPAs
            if entry.implementing_moa != request.user.moa_organization:
                raise PermissionDenied(
                    "You can only view PPAs for your MOA. "
                    f"This PPA belongs to {entry.implementing_moa}."
                )
        else:
            # MOA user cannot view OOBC initiatives or OBC requests
            raise PermissionDenied(
                "MOA users do not have access to this entry type. "
                "This is an OOBC internal function."
            )
```

**Result:**
- MOA user accessing other MOA's PPA detail: **PermissionDenied**
- MOA user accessing OOBC initiative detail: **PermissionDenied**
- MOA user accessing OBC request detail: **PermissionDenied**

---

### 6. OOBC Initiatives - Complete Block

**File:** `src/monitoring/views.py`

#### Views Blocked with `@moa_no_access`:
1. `oobc_initiatives_dashboard` - Main dashboard
2. `oobc_impact_report` - Impact assessment
3. `oobc_unit_performance` - Unit performance comparison
4. `export_oobc_data` - Data export
5. `oobc_budget_review` - Budget review
6. `oobc_community_feedback` - Community feedback

**Result:**
- MOA users attempting to access `/monitoring/oobc-initiatives/` → **PermissionDenied**
- MOA users attempting any OOBC initiative action → **PermissionDenied**

---

### 7. M&E Analytics - Complete Block

**File:** `src/project_central/views.py`

#### Views Blocked with `@moa_no_access`:
1. `me_analytics_dashboard` - Main analytics dashboard (`/project-management/analytics/`)
2. `sector_analytics` - Sector-specific analytics
3. `geographic_analytics` - Geographic distribution analytics
4. `policy_analytics` - Policy-specific analytics

**Result:**
- MOA users attempting to access `/project-management/analytics/` → **PermissionDenied**
- MOA users attempting any M&E analytics view → **PermissionDenied**
- Strategic analytics remain OOBC staff exclusive

1. `src/common/utils/moa_permissions.py` - Added decorators and helper functions
2. `src/common/models.py` - Added User model methods for services

### View Files:
3. `src/monitoring/views.py` - PPA filtering, OOBC initiatives blocking
4. `src/project_central/views.py` - M&E analytics blocking

### Models (Referenced, Not Modified):
5. `src/recommendations/policy_tracking/models.py` - PolicyRecommendation
6. `src/services/models.py` - ServiceOffering
7. `src/monitoring/models.py` - MonitoringEntry

---

## Migration Requirements

**None.** This implementation uses existing model fields and relationships. No database migrations needed.

---

## Security Considerations

### Defense in Depth:
1. **Decorator Level:** `@moa_no_access`, `@moa_can_edit_service`, `@moa_can_edit_ppa`
2. **View Level:** Queryset filtering in list views
3. **Detail Level:** Ownership checks in detail views
4. **Model Level:** User model methods for permission checking

### Error Handling:
- All blocked access raises `PermissionDenied` with clear messages
- User-friendly error messages explaining why access is denied
- No sensitive information leaked in error messages

### URL Protection:
- Even if MOA user guesses URLs, they will be blocked
- Direct object access (e.g., `/monitoring/entry/123/`) is protected
- API endpoints (if any) should use same decorators

---

## Future Considerations

### 1. Service Views Implementation
When service views are created:
```python
from common.utils.moa_permissions import moa_can_edit_service

@login_required
@moa_can_edit_service
def service_edit(request, pk):
    service = get_object_or_404(ServiceOffering, pk=pk)
    # ... edit logic

@login_required
def service_list(request):
    services = ServiceOffering.objects.all()

    # Filter for MOA users
    if request.user.is_moa_staff and request.user.moa_organization:
        services = services.filter(offering_moa=request.user.moa_organization)

    # ... list logic
```

### 2. API Endpoints
If REST APIs are created for these modules, ensure:
- Same decorators applied to API views
- DRF permission classes check `user.is_moa_staff`
- Queryset filtering in viewsets

### 3. Policy Model Enhancement (Optional)
If future requirements need MOA-specific policy filtering:
- Add `implementing_moa` FK to `PolicyRecommendation` model
- Migration required
- Update filtering logic from "blocked" to "filtered by MOA"

## Verification Commands

### Test MOA User Access:
```bash
# 1. Create test MOA user (if not exists)
cd src
./manage.py shell

from common.models import User
from coordination.models import Organization

# Create MOA organization
moa = Organization.objects.create(
    name="Ministry of Test",
    acronym="MOT",
    organization_type="bmoa"
)

# Create MOA user
user = User.objects.create_user(
    username="moa_test",
    email="moa_test@example.com",
    user_type="bmoa",
    is_approved=True
)
user.moa_organization = moa
user.save()

# 2. Login as MOA user in browser
# 3. Attempt to access blocked URLs:
# - /monitoring/oobc-initiatives/
# - /project-management/analytics/
# - /recommendations/policies/

# Expected: PermissionDenied with clear message
```

### Test PPA Filtering:
```bash
# 1. Login as MOA user
# 2. Navigate to /monitoring/moa-ppas/
# 3. Verify only own MOA's PPAs appear
# 4. Attempt to access other MOA's PPA detail by URL
# Expected: PermissionDenied
```
