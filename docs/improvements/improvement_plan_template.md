# Improvement Plan Template

## Overview
Provide a concise description of the feature or module you plan to improve. Mention the relevant templates/views/endpoints and the primary user pain points.

## Objectives
- List the key goals this improvement should achieve (e.g., usability, performance, compliance).
- Keep bullets action-oriented and measurable when possible.

## Scope
- Capture what is **in scope** for the effort (features, flows, user segments).
- Note what is **out of scope** to prevent scope creep and clarify expectations.

## Current Limitations
- Summarise the major issues with the current experience, grouped by theme (UX, data, workflows, etc.).
- Use bolded lead-ins for clarity (e.g., **Fragmented data**).

## Proposed Enhancements
### 1. First Workstream Title
- Outline the proposed changes for this area. Reference affected files or services.
- Add subsections for additional workstreams (`### 2`, `### 3`, etc.) as needed.

### 2. Second Workstream Title
- Continue describing enhancements, keeping bullets concise and implementation-oriented.

## Stakeholders & Ownership
- Identify product owners, engineering leads, QA, design, and other stakeholders accountable for delivery.
- Note external partners or approving bodies that must be engaged.

## Implementation Approach
1. **Phase or Activity Name** â€“ Detail discovery, design, development, testing, rollout steps in sequence.
2. Continue enumerating phases until the end-to-end path is clear.

## Dependencies & Risks
- Highlight data, integration, staffing, or infrastructure dependencies.
- Call out risks that could delay or block delivery, plus mitigation notes if available.

## Success Metrics
- Define objective metrics to evaluate the rollout (e.g., load times, satisfaction scores, adoption percentages).
- Include qualitative checkpoints if quantitative data is unavailable.

## Open Questions & Next Actions
- Document unresolved decisions, research needs, or validations required.
- Assign owners and target dates for closing each item.

## References
- Link to related documentation, code modules, research notes, or external standards.
- Remove this section if no references exist.
