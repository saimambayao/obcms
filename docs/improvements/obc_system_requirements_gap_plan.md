# Improvement Plan: Closing Partially Implemented & Pending System Requirements

## Overview
This plan consolidates enhancements needed to complete the partially implemented and not yet implemented requirements documented in `docs/reports/obc-system-requirements.md`. It targets platform reliability, security, interoperability, offline access, stakeholder transparency, and infrastructure scalability across Django apps (`common`, `monitoring`, `coordination`, `recommendations`, `mana`) and deployment tooling. Core pain points include manual approval workflows, lack of automation for backups and audits, missing MFA/SSO, single-server deployments, and absence of a public transparency portal.

## Objectives
- Achieve production-grade reliability (backups, disaster recovery, monitoring) and meet a 99.5% uptime target.
- Deliver end-to-end security safeguards (MFA, SSO, encryption at rest, audit logs, compliance checkpoints).
- Provide stakeholders with offline data capture, richer collaboration, and a public transparency portal.
- Enable scalable infrastructure through containerization, CI/CD, and cloud-ready architecture.
- Expand interoperability via secured APIs, webhook/eventing, and government data exchange pipelines.

## Scope
- **In Scope**: Authentication hardening, infrastructure automation, offline sync, public reporting portal, integration tooling, usability/accessibility upgrades, and data governance practices.
- **Out of Scope**: Major redesign of existing business workflows, replacement of Django framework, or procurement of external hardware.

## Current Limitations
- **Infrastructure fragility**: Single-instance deployments lack automated backups and monitoring.
- **Security gaps**: No MFA/SSO, limited encryption controls, minimal audit logging.
- **Interoperability gaps**: REST APIs exist but without standardized auth, rate limiting, or outbound webhooks.
- **Offline constraints**: Field teams cannot capture data without connectivity; no service workers or sync strategy.
- **Transparency shortfalls**: No live public portal or open-data exports for communities.

## Proposed Enhancements
### 1. Production-Ready Infrastructure & Reliability
- Containerize services (Docker/Compose) with per-environment overrides under `deployment/containers/`; define Terraform stacks for staging/production VPC, Postgres, Redis, and object storage.
- Implement automated PostgreSQL + media backups via `deployment/scripts/backup.sh`, store in encrypted buckets, and document restore drills in `docs/admin-guide/operations.md`.
- Add monitoring/alerting using Prometheus + Grafana (metrics), Loki (logs), and Uptime Kuma (synthetic checks); surface health dashboards for PMO leadership.
- Harden deployment pipeline with GitHub Actions runners that lint, run `pytest --ds=obc_management.settings`, build images, and push to registry before triggering IaC apply.

### 2. Security & Compliance Hardening
- Integrate Django-compatible MFA (`django-otp` + WebAuthn) and SSO (SAML gateway) within `src/common/auth/` while preserving fallback OTP codes for field teams.
- Enforce HTTPS and HSTS via ingress controllers, enable database encryption at rest (cloud KMS-managed keys), and store secrets in Vault; remove plaintext credentials from `.env`.
- Extend `src/common/middleware/audit.py` to capture create/update/delete events with user context, expose audit viewer in `src/administration` app, and archive to WORM storage monthly.
- Schedule quarterly vulnerability scans (OpenVAS) and annual external penetration testing; integrate OWASP Dependency-Check into CI and fail builds on critical CVEs.

### 3. Offline & Mobile Enhancements
- Deliver a PWA shell (`src/templates/base_pwa.html`) with service worker caching strategies, IndexedDB storage via Dexie, and background sync using Django Channels endpoints.
- Refactor `mana` field assessment forms to queue submissions locally, show sync state badges, and auto-resume uploads when connectivity returns.
- Provide offline-capable task lists for `monitoring` officers with delta updates from server; include retry logic and conflict prompts when data diverges.
- Publish training playbooks for LGU staff covering install-to-sync workflows and troubleshooting of offline caches.

### 4. Stakeholder Transparency & Collaboration
- Build a public transparency portal (`src/transparency`) exposing curated KPIs, budget utilization timelines, and document repositories using `components/data_table_card.html`.
- Add CSV/JSON export endpoints with throttling and caching; publish open-data schemas in `docs/reports/public-data-catalog.md`.
- Enable document co-authoring by extending `documents` app with inline comments, change tracking, and external reviewer roles gated by scoped permissions.
- Embed feedback capture widgets so communities can submit clarifications directly, storing responses under `policy_tracking` for triage.

### 5. Interoperability & Integrations
- Stand up API key provisioning UI under `src/common/admin_api.py`, enforce scoped keys, per-client rate limiting (Redis), and webhook subscription management.
- Provide outbound webhooks for policy approvals, budget releases, and incident escalations; queue retries through Celery workers with dead-letter handling.
- Build data exchange adapters in `src/data_imports` for BARMM ministries (JSON APIs) and national agencies (SFTP CSV); configure nightly ETL jobs and reconciliation reports.
- Document integration contracts and versioning guidelines in `docs/guidelines/api-governance.md`.

### 6. Data Governance & Quality Controls
- Institute data classification matrices and retention policies, capturing mappings in `docs/guidelines/data-governance.md`.
- Add validation pipelines (Great Expectations) for critical datasets, surfacing failures in Slack/Teams notifications.
- Expand role-based access controls to restrict sensitive reports; audit permissions quarterly and log variances.

## Stakeholders & Ownership
- **Product Owner**: OOBC PMO Lead
- **Engineering Lead**: Senior Django Engineer (Common Platform Team)
- **DevOps Lead**: Infrastructure Engineer (Deployment & Ops)

## Implementation Approach
1. **Discovery & Architecture Baseline** – Complete gap analysis, refresh system context diagrams, and convert requirements into Jira epics mapped to this plan.
2. **Security & Identity Foundations** – Prototype MFA/SSO in staging, migrate users, roll out secrets management, and update onboarding playbooks.
3. **Reliability & Infrastructure Automation** – Containerize Django + worker services, enable IaC pipelines, configure backups/restore drills, and publish ops guides.
4. **Offline & Mobile Enablement** – Deliver service worker + IndexedDB scaffolding, retrofit priority workflows, and beta test with pilot municipalities.
5. **Transparency & Collaboration Enhancements** – Build public portal, connect data exports, implement document collaboration, and run accessibility review.
6. **Integration Rollout** – Launch API key system, webhooks, and data exchange adapters; sign MOUs with partner agencies and monitor pilot exchanges.
7. **Compliance & Performance Readiness** – Execute vulnerability scans, load/stress tests, data privacy impact assessment, and finalize governance documentation.
8. **Launch & Post-Go-Live Monitoring** – Perform staged cutovers, host training (LGU, PMO, external partners), monitor KPIs, and schedule retrospective.

## Dependencies & Risks
- **Identity provider availability** – SSO relies on BARMM CIO SAML endpoint; mitigation: confirm test credentials Sprint 0.
- **Infrastructure budget** – Cloud resources (K8s, monitoring stack) must be approved; mitigation: deliver phased cost model and ROI briefings.
- **Field connectivity variability** – Offline sync quality depends on real-world coverage; mitigation: run pilot with low-connectivity LGUs, capture telemetry.
- **Data privacy approvals** – Public datasets require legal clearance; mitigation: conduct Privacy Impact Assessment and build redaction tooling.
- **Staff capacity** – Multiple teams engaged simultaneously; mitigation: secure rotational support, contract DevOps specialist, and enforce WIP limits.
- **Legacy browser support** – PWA requires service worker support; mitigation: provide fallback read-only flows and publish compatibility matrix.

## Success Metrics
- 99.5% uptime sustained over 90 days post-launch, monitored via synthetic checks and Grafana dashboards.
