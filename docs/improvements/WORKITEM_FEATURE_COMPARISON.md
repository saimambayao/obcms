- Strategic alignment algorithms
- No vendor lock-in
- Data sovereignty

**Recommendation:**
Develop OBCMS WorkItem into a government-grade EPPM platform through systematic implementation of 5 enhancement phases. Start with quick wins to prove value, then proceed with foundation and advanced features.

**Strategic Value:**
- **Customization:** Unlimited tailoring to BARMM needs
- **Compliance:** Built-in COA/DICT/PeGIF support
- **Sovereignty:** Full data control, no vendor access
- **Long-term control:** No recurring licensing fees, platform ownership
- **Strategic alignment:** Purpose-built for BARMM digital transformation
