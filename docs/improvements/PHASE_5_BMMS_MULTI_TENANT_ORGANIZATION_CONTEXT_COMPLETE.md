# Phase 5: BMMS Multi-Tenant Organization Context - COMPLETE

**Status:** ✅ Implementation Complete
**Priority:** MEDIUM
**Date:** 2025-10-13
**Related:** [BMMS Transition Plan](../plans/bmms/TRANSITION_PLAN.md)

## Executive Summary

Successfully implemented comprehensive multi-tenant organization context for BMMS (Bangsamoro Ministerial Management System). The system now supports organization-scoped data isolation for 44 MOAs (Ministries, Offices, and Agencies) with special OCM (Office of Chief Minister) aggregation access.

## Implementation Overview

### 1. Organization Context Middleware ✅

**File:** `src/common/middleware/organization_context.py`

**Features:**
- Extracts organization from URL kwargs, query params, session, or user default
- Validates user access to organization
- Sets `request.organization` attribute
- Handles OCM special case (read-only access to all MOAs)
- Session-based organization persistence

**Priority Order:**
1. URL kwargs (`org_id`, `organization_id`)
2. Query parameters (`?org=...`)
3. User's default organization (`user.moa_organization`)
4. Session (`request.session['current_organization']`)

**Security:**
- MOA staff: Limited to their organization only
- OOBC staff: Access to all organizations
- OCM users: Read-only access to all MOAs

### 2. Enhanced RBAC Service ✅

**File:** `src/common/services/rbac_service.py`

**New Methods:**
- `get_user_organization_context(request)` - Extract org from request
- `has_permission(request, feature_code, organization)` - Org-aware permissions
- `get_organizations_with_access(user)` - List accessible organizations
- `can_switch_organization(user)` - Check if user can switch orgs
- `get_permission_context(request)` - Complete permission context for templates

**Features:**
- Organization-scoped permission checks
- OCM aggregation support (read-only)
- Permission caching (5-minute timeout)
- Integration with middleware organization context

### 3. Organization-Scoped Mixins ✅

**File:** `src/common/mixins/organization_mixins.py`

**Mixins Implemented:**

#### OrganizationFilteredMixin
- Auto-filters queryset by organization
- Respects user's organization access
- Configurable filter field (`organization_filter_field`)

#### OrganizationFormMixin
- Pre-fills organization in forms
- Disables organization field for MOA staff
- Validates organization access before save

#### MultiOrganizationAccessMixin
- Supports filtering across multiple organizations
- Query parameter-based org selection (`?orgs=uuid1&orgs=uuid2`)
- OOBC/OCM only (MOA staff restricted)

### 4. OCM Aggregation Mixins ✅

**File:** `src/common/mixins/ocm_mixins.py`

**Mixins Implemented:**

#### OCMAggregationMixin
- Cross-MOA visibility for OCM
- Read-only enforcement
- Aggregated statistics generation

#### OCMDashboardMixin
- Multi-MOA comparison charts
- Trend analysis methods
- Export capabilities

#### OCMReadOnlyDetailMixin
- Detail view with edit/delete disabled for OCM
- Clear read-only messaging

### 5. View Examples ✅

**File:** `src/common/views/organization_examples.py`

**Examples Provided:**
- `CommunityListView` - Organization-filtered list
- `CommunityDetailView` - Organization-scoped detail
- `CommunityCreateView` - Form with org context
- `ActivityListView` - Related field filtering
- `AssessmentListView` - MANA with MOA blocking
- `OCMDashboardView` - Multi-MOA dashboard
- `CrossMOAReportView` - Multi-org reports

**Helper Functions:**
- `get_organization_choices(user)` - Org choices for forms
- `validate_organization_access(user, org)` - Access validation
- `switch_organization(request, org_id)` - Org switching

### 6. UI Components ✅

**File:** `src/templates/components/organization_selector.html`

**Features:**
- Visual organization context display
- Organization switching dropdown (if authorized)
- User role badges (OCM, MOA Staff, OOBC Staff)
- Organization acronym icons
- Alpine.js powered interactivity
- Tailwind CSS responsive design

**Usage:**
```django
{% include 'components/organization_selector.html' %}
```

### 7. Settings Configuration ✅

**File:** `src/obc_management/settings/base.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added `OrganizationContextMiddleware` to `MIDDLEWARE` (after AuthenticationMiddleware)
2. Added `RBAC_SETTINGS` configuration:

```python
RBAC_SETTINGS = {
    'ENABLE_MULTI_TENANT': True,
    'OCM_ORGANIZATION_CODE': 'ocm',
    'CACHE_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'ALLOW_ORGANIZATION_SWITCHING': True,
    'SESSION_ORG_KEY': 'current_organization',
}
```

### 8. Comprehensive Tests ✅

**File:** `src/common/tests/test_organization_context.py`

**Test Coverage:**
- `OrganizationContextMiddlewareTestCase` - Middleware functionality
- `UserAccessPermissionsTestCase` - Access permissions
- `RBACServiceTestCase` - RBAC service methods
- `OrganizationScopedQuerySetTestCase` - Queryset filtering
- `OCMAggregationTestCase` - OCM aggregation access

**Test Scenarios:**
- Organization extraction from URL, query params, session
- User access validation (OOBC, MOA, OCM)
- Organization switching permissions
- Permission checking with org context
- Queryset filtering by organization
- OCM read-only enforcement

## Architecture Decisions

### Data Isolation Strategy

**MOA Staff:**
- ❌ Cannot access other MOAs' data
- ✅ Locked to their organization
- ❌ Cannot switch organizations
- ✅ Organization field disabled in forms

**OOBC Staff:**
- ✅ Access to all organizations (operational)
- ✅ Can switch between organizations
- ✅ Full CRUD permissions
- ✅ Organization field enabled in forms

**OCM Users:**
- ✅ Read-only access to all MOAs (oversight)
- ✅ Can switch to view different MOAs
- ❌ Cannot create/edit/delete
- ✅ Aggregated dashboards and reports

### Organization Context Priority

```
1. URL kwargs (explicit selection)
   ↓
2. Query parameters (user selection)
   ↓
3. User's default organization (MOA staff)
   ↓
4. Session storage (previous selection)
   ↓
5. None (no organization context)
```

### Security Principles

1. **Data Isolation:** MOA A cannot see MOA B's data
2. **OCM Exception:** Read-only access for oversight
3. **Backward Compatible:** Works with existing OOBC (no organization)
4. **Fail Secure:** No organization = empty queryset
5. **Explicit Access:** Must validate access before showing data

## Integration Guide

### Using in Views

```python
from common.mixins.organization_mixins import OrganizationFilteredMixin
from django.views.generic import ListView

class MyListView(OrganizationFilteredMixin, ListView):
    model = MyModel
    organization_filter_field = 'implementing_moa'  # FK to Organization
```

### Using in Templates

```django
{# Check organization context #}
{% if current_organization %}
    <p>Viewing: {{ current_organization.name }}</p>
{% endif %}

{# Include organization selector #}
{% include 'components/organization_selector.html' %}
```

### Using RBAC Service

```python
from common.services.rbac_service import RBACService

# Check permission with org context
if RBACService.has_permission(request, 'communities.view_obc_community'):
    # Permission automatically scoped to request.organization
    queryset = Community.objects.all()

# Get accessible organizations
orgs = RBACService.get_organizations_with_access(request.user)

# Get permission context for templates
context = RBACService.get_permission_context(request)
```

## Migration Path

### Existing Views

1. **Add Organization Filter Mixin:**
   ```python
   class ExistingView(OrganizationFilteredMixin, ListView):
       organization_filter_field = 'moa_organization'
   ```

2. **Update Forms:**
   ```python
   class ExistingCreateView(OrganizationFormMixin, CreateView):
       organization_field_name = 'moa_organization'
   ```

3. **Add OCM Support (Optional):**
   ```python
   class ReportView(OCMAggregationMixin, ListView):
       # OCM gets aggregated view
   ```

### Database Models

**No migration required!** Uses existing:
- `User.moa_organization` (FK to Organization)
- `Organization` model from coordination app
- Existing MOA RBAC infrastructure

## Performance Considerations

**Caching:**
- Permission checks cached for 5 minutes
- Organization context cached in session
- Lazy loading of organization object

**Database:**
- Use `select_related('moa_organization')` for user queries
- Index on `moa_organization` FK fields
- Efficient organization filtering

**Best Practices:**
- Cache organization choices in forms
- Use prefetch for related organizations
- Minimize organization context switches

## Security Audit

### Access Control ✅
- [x] MOA staff cannot access other MOAs
- [x] OCM has read-only access

## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts
- **MOA:** Ministry, Office, or Agency (44 organizations)
- **OCM:** Office of Chief Minister (oversight role)
- **OOBC:** Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (operations)
- **Organization Context:** Current organization user is viewing/editing

### User Roles & Access
| Role | Access Level | Can Switch | Data Scope |
|------|-------------|------------|-----------|
| MOA Staff | Read/Write | ❌ No | Own MOA only |
| OOBC Staff | Full | ✅ Yes | All MOAs |
| OCM User | Read-Only | ✅ Yes | All MOAs |
| Superuser | Full | ✅ Yes | All |

### Common Patterns
```python
# 1. Get organization from request
organization = request.organization

# 2. Filter queryset by organization
queryset = Model.objects.filter(moa_organization=organization)

# 3. Check if user can access org
if user_can_access_organization(user, organization):
    # Allow access

# 4. Get accessible organizations
orgs = RBACService.get_organizations_with_access(user)
```

## Conclusion

Phase 5 successfully implements comprehensive multi-tenant support for BMMS. The system now provides:

✅ **Data Isolation:** MOA A cannot access MOA B's data
✅ **OCM Oversight:** Read-only aggregation across all MOAs
✅ **Flexible Access:** OOBC staff can switch between organizations
✅ **Security:** Validated access controls at every level
✅ **Performance:** Efficient caching and lazy loading
✅ **Backward Compatible:** Works with existing OOBC system

The implementation is ready for Phase 6 (OCM Aggregation) and Phase 7 (Pilot MOA Onboarding).
