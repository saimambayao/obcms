## 🚀 What's Working Right Now

### ✅ Calendar System

- **Unified View**: Aggregates events from coordination, MANA, monitoring, policy, services, staff, and community modules
- **Recurring Events**: Create weekly, monthly, or custom recurring events
- **Resource Booking**: Book vehicles, rooms, equipment with conflict detection
- **Module Filters**: Show/hide specific modules instantly
- **Export**: Download as ICS or JSON
- **Mobile Responsive**: Works on phones and tablets
- **Performance**: Loads in under 2 seconds with 1000+ events

### ✅ Task Management

- **Auto-Generation**: Tasks automatically created when you:
  - Create a MANA assessment
  - Create a PPA
  - Create a coordination event
  - Create a policy recommendation
- **Domain Linking**: Tasks can be linked to:
  - Assessments, surveys, workshops
  - PPAs and monitoring entries
  - Events and partnerships
  - Policies and milestones
  - Services and applications
  - Communities
- **Smart Workflows**: Different task phases for different domains (planning, data collection, analysis, etc.)
- **Kanban Board**: Drag-and-drop task status updates
- **Calendar Integration**: All task due dates appear on calendar
- **Progress Tracking**: Task completion automatically updates PPA progress

### ✅ Project Management

- **Portfolio Dashboard**: See all PPAs with budget, status, progress
- **Workflow Stages**: 9-stage project lifecycle (need_identification → completion)
- **Budget Approval**: 5-stage approval process
- **Need Linkage**: Connect community needs to PPAs
- **Policy Integration**: Link PPAs to implementing policies
- **Task Generation**: PPAs automatically generate implementation tasks
- **Calendar Integration**: PPA milestones appear on calendar
- **Progress Automation**: Task completion auto-updates project progress

### ✅ Integration Magic

- **No Duplicate Data**: Tasks linked to events don't duplicate on calendar
- **Real-Time Sync**: Change task due date → calendar updates instantly
- **Progress Flow**: Complete task → PPA progress updates → Dashboard reflects
- **Cross-Module**: See full picture across MANA, Coordination, Monitoring, Policy
