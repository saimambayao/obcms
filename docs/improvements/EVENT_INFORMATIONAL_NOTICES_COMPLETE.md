# Event Model Informational Notices - Implementation Complete

**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Type:** Informational Enhancement (NOT Deprecation)

---

## Overview

Per the Event Model audit, the Event model is **NOT deprecated** and remains fully supported. However, users should be informed about the WorkItem Activity alternative for simple project activities.

This implementation adds **informational notices** (blue info boxes, NOT amber warnings) to guide users in choosing between Event and WorkItem Activity.

---

## Objective

**Goal:** Inform users about the choice between Event and WorkItem Activity without deprecating Event.

**Key Principle:** Event is still supported and recommended for coordination meetings with participant tracking. This is purely informational, not a deprecation.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Event Admin Informational Notice

**File:** `src/coordination/admin.py`

**Change:** Added informational note to EventAdmin docstring

```python
@admin.register(Event)
class EventAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    """
    Admin interface for Events.

    Note: For simple project activities without participant tracking,
    consider using WorkItem (type=Activity). Event is recommended for
    coordination meetings with participant management.
    """
```

**Impact:**
- Visible to developers viewing admin code
- Appears in admin interface docstrings
- Clear guidance without deprecation language

---

### 2. Event Form Template Notice

**File:** `src/templates/coordination/event_form.html`

**Change:** Added blue informational banner at top of form

```html
<!-- Informational Notice -->
<div class="bg-blue-50 border-l-4 border-blue-500 p-4 rounded-lg">
    <div class="flex">
        <div class="flex-shrink-0">
            <i class="fas fa-info-circle text-blue-500 text-lg"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="ml-3">
            <p class="text-sm text-blue-700">
                <strong>Tip:</strong> For simple project activities without participant tracking,
                you may also use <a href="{% url 'common:work_item_list' %}" class="underline font-semibold hover:text-blue-900">WorkItem Activities</a>.
                Event is recommended for coordination meetings with participant management and detailed tracking.
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

**Impact:**
- Users see informational tip when creating/editing events

                <strong>Tip:</strong> Events are designed for coordination meetings with participant tracking and detailed management.
                For simple project activities, consider using <a href="{% url 'common:work_item_list' %}" class="underline font-semibold hover:text-blue-900">WorkItem Activities</a> instead.

## Key Decisions

### Decision 1: Blue Info, NOT Amber Warning

**Rationale:** Event is NOT deprecated. This is informational guidance, not a warning about deprecation.

**Implementation:** Used `bg-blue-50`, `border-blue-500`, `text-blue-700`, `fa-info-circle` styling.

### Decision 2: Link to WorkItem Activities

**Rationale:** Users should be able to easily discover the alternative system.

**Implementation:** Added direct links to `{% url 'common:work_item_list' %}` in all notices.

### Decision 3: Emphasize Event Still Recommended

**Rationale:** Users should not feel pressured to migrate away from Event.

**Implementation:** Every notice includes "Event is recommended for coordination meetings with participant management."

### Decision 4: Comprehensive Decision Guide

**Rationale:** Developers and power users need detailed guidance on choosing between systems.

**Implementation:** Created 13KB decision guide with examples, feature comparison, FAQs, and workflows.
