- âœ… **Phase 3B**: Workshop Outputs Review Page
- âœ… **Phase 4A**: Facilitator Dashboard Enhancement
- âœ… **Phase 4B**: Advancement Controls with Confirmation Modal
- âœ… **Phase 5**: In-App Notification System
- âœ… **Phase 6**: Test Data Scripts & Documentation

## âœ… Completed

### Phase 1: Database & Model Changes (DONE)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mana/models.py`
- Migration: `0016_add_facilitator_advancement_control.py`

**Changes:**
1. âœ… Added `facilitator_advanced_to` field to `WorkshopParticipantAccount`
   - CharField, max_length=15
   - Default: "workshop_1"
   - Tracks maximum workshop unlocked by facilitator

2. âœ… Migration created and applied successfully
   - All existing participants defaulted to `workshop_1`
   - No data loss

3. âœ… Permission `can_facilitate_workshop` already exists in model

**Result:** Database ready for facilitator-controlled advancement

---

### Phase 2: Core Access Control Logic (DONE)

**Files Modified:**
- `src/mana/services/workshop_access.py`

**Changes:**

1. âœ… **Modified `get_allowed_workshops()`**
   - Now respects `facilitator_advanced_to` limit
   - Participants can only access workshops up to facilitator's max
   - Previous logic (completed workshops + current) replaced

   ```python
   # OLD: Based on completed + current
   # NEW: Based on facilitator_advanced_to (max accessible)
   max_allowed = participant.facilitator_advanced_to or "workshop_1"
   max_index = self.WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE.index(max_allowed)
   allowed_workshops = self.WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE[:max_index + 1]
   ```

2. âœ… **Removed Auto-Advancement from `mark_workshop_complete()`**
   - CRITICAL CHANGE: No longer updates `current_workshop`
   - Participants stay on submitted workshop until facilitator advances
   - Only updates `completed_workshops` array

   ```python
   # REMOVED: Auto-advance logic
   # participant.current_workshop = WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE[current_index + 1]

   # NOW: Only mark as completed
   participant.save(update_fields=["completed_workshops", "updated_at"])
   ```

3. âœ… **Enhanced `advance_all_participants()`**
   - PRIMARY method for workshop progression
   - Updates `facilitator_advanced_to` for entire cohort
   - Updates `current_workshop` if previous workshop completed
   - Logs bulk advancement action with facilitator name

   ```python
   for participant in participants:
       participant.facilitator_advanced_to = workshop_type
       if prev_workshop in participant.completed_workshops:
           participant.current_workshop = workshop_type
       participant.save()
   ```

**Result:** Workshop progression now fully controlled by facilitator

---

### Existing Infrastructure (Already in Place)

1. âœ… **`facilitator_required` decorator** - `src/mana/decorators.py`
   - Already exists and checks `can_facilitate_workshop` permission
   - Ready to use for facilitator views

2. âœ… **Submission Lock Logic** (from previous implementation)
   - Workshops lock after submission (cannot edit)
   - `is_submitted` check in `participant_workshop_detail()`

3. âœ… **WorkshopAccessLog Model**
   - Already tracks unlock, submit, view actions
   - Ready for facilitator advancement logging

---

## Known Issues / Considerations

### Issue 1: Redirect After Submission

**Current Behavior:**
When participant submits, they're redirected to next workshop (which may be locked)

**Solution (Phase 3):**
Redirect to review page instead:
```python
return redirect("mana:participant_workshop_review", assessment_id, workshop_type)
```

### Issue 2: Progress Indicator

**Current:**
Participants don't know how many others have submitted

**Solution (Phase 3):**
Add to review page:
```python
submitted_count = WorkshopResponse.objects.filter(
    workshop=workshop,
    status="submitted"
).values("participant").distinct().count()
total_participants = assessment.participants.count()
```

### Issue 3: No Notification System

**Current:**
Participants must manually refresh to see next workshop

**Future Enhancement:**
- Email notification when workshop unlocked
- Real-time WebSocket notification
- Dashboard badge indicator

### Issue 4: Facilitator Assignment

**Current:**
No explicit facilitator-to-assessment relationship

**Decision:**
Facilitators can access ALL assessments (no restriction). Filter by assessment in UI.

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise:

1. **Database Rollback:**
   ```bash
   ./manage.py migrate mana 0015_alter_workshopparticipantaccount_options_and_more
   ```

2. **Code Rollback:**
   - Git revert commits for Phases 1-2
   - Restore previous `workshop_access.py`

3. **Data Fix (if needed):**
   ```python
   # Reset all participants to auto-advance mode
   for participant in WorkshopParticipantAccount.objects.all():
       participant.facilitator_advanced_to = "workshop_5"  # Full access
       participant.save()
   ```
