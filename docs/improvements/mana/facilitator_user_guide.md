## Advancing Participants

### When to Advance

**Recommended Criteria**:
- ‚úÖ At least 70% of participants have submitted
- ‚úÖ You've reviewed the quality of submissions
- ‚úÖ Sufficient data collected for synthesis
- ‚úÖ Timeline allows for next workshop

**Important**: When you advance, **ALL participants** move forward, including those who haven't submitted. Non-submitters can still access the previous workshop but also gain access to the next one.

### Advancement Process

1. **Check Progress**
   - Review the progress bar
   - Verify submission count meets your threshold

2. **Initiate Advancement**
   - Scroll to top of dashboard
   - Look for blue button: **"Advance All Participants to Workshop X"**
   - Click the button

3. **Confirmation Modal**
   - A modal appears showing:
     - Next workshop name
     - Total participant count
     - Current submission status (X/Y submitted)
     - Warning about non-submitters
   - Read the information carefully

4. **Confirm Action**
   - Click **"Confirm Advancement"** to proceed
   - OR click **"Cancel"** to abort

5. **Verification**
   - Toast notification confirms: "Advanced X participants to Workshop Y"
   - Button text updates to show next workshop
   - Participants receive **in-app notifications**

### What Happens After Advancement?

**For Participants**:
- üîî **Notification appears** on their dashboard
- üîì **Next workshop unlocks** immediately
- ‚úÖ **Previous workshop remains accessible** (read-only if submitted)

**For You**:
- üìä Progress bar resets for new workshop
- üîÑ Can switch to new workshop tab to monitor
- üìß Can continue to review previous workshops anytime

### Advancement Best Practices

‚úÖ **DO**:
- Advance during logical break points (end of day, between sessions)
- Communicate advancement schedule to participants beforehand
- Review at least a sample of submissions before advancing
- Advance all workshops eventually (don't leave participants stuck)

‚ùå **DON'T**:
- Advance too quickly (give participants time to submit)
- Advance late at night (participants won't see notifications)
- Skip workshops (sequence is enforced)
- Wait for 100% submission (unlikely to achieve)

## AI Synthesis

### Overview

The AI Synthesis feature generates consolidated summaries of participant responses using artificial intelligence. This helps you quickly understand themes, patterns, and key findings.

### Prerequisites

- AI API keys must be configured by system administrator
- Supported providers: OpenAI (GPT-4), Anthropic (Claude)
- At least 3-5 participant submissions recommended for meaningful synthesis

### Generating Synthesis

1. Scroll to **"AI Synthesis"** section (below responses table)

2. **Configure Filters** (Optional):
   - **Province**: Generate synthesis for specific province only
   - **Stakeholder Type**: Focus on specific stakeholder group
   - Leave blank for all responses

3. **Select Provider**:
   - **OpenAI**: GPT-4 (recommended for detailed analysis)
   - **Anthropic**: Claude (alternative, similar quality)

4. **Custom Prompt** (Optional):
   - Add specific instructions for the AI
   - Example: "Focus on economic development themes"
   - Leave blank to use default template

5. **Click "Generate Synthesis"**
   - Process runs asynchronously (in background)
   - Usually takes 30-60 seconds

### Viewing Synthesis Results

- Synthesis appears in **grid below** the form
- Each card shows:
  - **Status**: Draft, Pending, Approved
  - **Timestamp**: When generated
  - **Provider & Model**: AI system used
  - **Synthesized Text**: Full output

### Synthesis Actions

**Regenerate**:
- Click **"Regenerate"** to create a new version
- Useful if first result is unsatisfactory
- Previous versions remain visible

**Approve**:
- Click **"Approve"** to mark as final
- Indicates this synthesis is ready for reports
- Status changes to "Approved"

### Best Practices for Synthesis

‚úÖ **Wait for sufficient data**: Generate after 50%+ submissions
‚úÖ **Review AI output**: Always validate accuracy before using
‚úÖ **Use filters strategically**: Compare different demographic groups
‚úÖ **Keep multiple versions**: Regenerate to compare perspectives

## Best Practices

### Weekly Workflow

**Monday**:
1. Login and check progress across all assessments
2. Send reminder emails/messages to non-submitters
3. Review new submissions from weekend

**Wednesday**:
1. Mid-week progress check
2. Follow up with participants who haven't started
3. Review sample submissions for quality

**Friday**:
1. Final progress check before weekend
2. Decide if ready to advance
3. Generate synthesis reports for completed workshops
4. Advance participants if criteria met

### Communication Tips

‚úÖ **Be transparent**: Tell participants when you plan to advance
‚úÖ **Set expectations**: "We'll advance when 70% submit"
‚úÖ **Send reminders**: "Workshop 2 closes Thursday at 5 PM"
‚úÖ **Acknowledge submissions**: "Great work on Workshop 1!"

### Quality Assurance

**Spot-Check Submissions**:
- Review 20-30% of responses before advancing
- Look for:
  - ‚úÖ Complete responses (all questions answered)
  - ‚úÖ Thoughtful answers (not just "N/A" or empty)
  - ‚úÖ Relevant content (answers match questions)

**Red Flags**:
- ‚ùå Very short responses (< 10 words)
- ‚ùå Copy-paste answers (identical across questions)
- ‚ùå Nonsense text or placeholder data
- ‚ùå Missing required fields

**What to Do**:
1. Contact participant directly (email/phone)
2. Ask for clarification or resubmission
3. Provide guidance on expected detail level
4. Extend deadline if necessary

### Time Management

**Allocate Time**:
- **10 mins/day**: Quick progress check
- **30 mins/week**: Review submissions thoroughly
- **1 hour/workshop**: Synthesis generation and review
- **2 hours/assessment**: Final reporting and documentation

## Troubleshooting

### "I can't see any assessments"

**Cause**: You're not assigned to any assessments

**Solution**:
1. Contact your supervisor or system administrator
2. Verify your facilitator permission is active
3. Request assignment to specific assessments

### "Progress bar shows 0% but I know participants submitted"

**Cause**: You're viewing a different workshop tab

**Solution**:
1. Check which workshop tab is selected (top of dashboard)
2. Switch to the correct workshop tab
3. Verify filters aren't hiding submissions (set to "All")

### "Advance button not appearing"

**Possible Causes**:
- You're already on the last workshop (Workshop 5)
- All participants already advanced
- System error (rare)

**Solution**:
1. Check which workshop tab is currently selected
2. If Workshop 5, advancement complete (no more workshops)
3. If earlier workshop, refresh page
4. Contact admin if problem persists

### "Synthesis generation failed"

**Possible Causes**:
- AI API keys not configured
- No responses to synthesize
- Network error

**Solution**:
1. Verify at least 3 responses exist for selected filters
2. Try different AI provider
3. Wait 5 minutes and try again
4. Contact IT support if persists

### "Export downloads empty file"

**Cause**: Filters are too restrictive or no data exists

**Solution**:
1. Reset filters to "All" for Province and Stakeholder
2. Verify submissions exist in responses table
3. Try different export format
4. Check browser download settings

### "Participants report they didn't receive notification"

**Cause**: Notification system might have delay

**Solution**:
1. Ask participant to refresh their dashboard
2. Verify notification exists in database (contact admin)
3. Communicate advancement via email/SMS as backup
4. Ensure participant has logged in recently
