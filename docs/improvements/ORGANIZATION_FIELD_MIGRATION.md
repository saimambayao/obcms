# Organization Field Migration Complete

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Migration File:** `src/common/migrations/0042_migrate_organization_to_moa_organization.py`
**Date:** 2025-10-13

## Overview

Successfully migrated legacy `organization` CharField to the new `moa_organization` ForeignKey in the User model. This migration ensures all users are properly linked to organizations in the coordination.Organization registry.

## Problem Statement

The User model had both:
- **LEGACY:** `organization = CharField` (line 46-48) - free text field
- **NEW:** `moa_organization = ForeignKey('coordination.Organization')` (line 71-78) - proper FK relationship

Users still had data like:
```
"Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities, Office of the Chief Minister (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao)"
```

This was incompatible with the coordination.Organization registry which uses structured organization records.

## Migration Strategy

### 1. Organization Mapping
The migration intelligently maps legacy text to Organization records using:

**Pattern Matching:**
- Multiple text variations for OOBC:
  - "Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities"
  - "Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities, Office of the Chief Minister"
  - "Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities, Office of the Chief Minister (Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao)"
  - "OOBC"

**Fallback Matching:**
- Case-insensitive name matching
- Acronym matching
- Graceful handling of not-found organizations

### 2. OOBC Organization Creation
The migration ensures OOBC organization exists:
```python
oobc_org, created = Organization.objects.get_or_create(
    acronym='OOBC',
    defaults={
        'name': 'Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities',
        'organization_type': 'bmoa',
        'description': 'The Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities serves Bangsamoro communities outside BARMM territory.',
        'is_active': True,
    }
)
```

### 3. User Type Coverage
Handles all user types with organization text:
- ✅ OOBC Staff (`oobc_staff`)
- ✅ OOBC Executives (`oobc_executive`)
- ✅ MOA Staff (`bmoa`, `lgu`, `nga`)

## Migration Results

### Successful Migration
```
Total users migrated: 25
Users without match: 0
Success rate: 100%
```

**Users migrated:**
- 2 OOBC Executives
- 23 OOBC Staff
- All properly linked to OOBC organization in coordination.Organization

### Verification
```sql
-- All users with organization text now have moa_organization FK
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth_user
WHERE organization IS NOT NULL
  AND organization != ''
  AND moa_organization_id IS NOT NULL;
-- Result: 25

-- No orphaned organization text
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM auth_user
WHERE organization IS NOT NULL
  AND organization != ''
  AND moa_organization_id IS NULL;
-- Result: 0
```

## Code Quality

### Reversibility
The migration is fully reversible:
```python
def reverse_migration(apps, schema_editor):
    """Clear moa_organization FK (keep organization CharField intact)."""
    User.objects.all().update(moa_organization=None)
```

**Tested:**
- ✅ Forward migration: 25 users migrated
- ✅ Reverse migration: moa_organization cleared, organization text preserved
- ✅ Re-apply: 25 users re-migrated successfully

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing organizations
- Reports organizations not found in database
- Handles multiple matches gracefully
- Detailed logging for debugging

### Django Best Practices
- Uses `apps.get_model()` for migration safety
- Atomic operations
- Proper dependency declarations
- Clear forward/reverse functions

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Deprecation Warning (Current)
The `organization` CharField remains in place with data intact:
- ✅ Migration complete
- ✅ All users have moa_organization FK
- ⏳ organization CharField still active (no null constraint yet)

### Phase 2: CharField Deprecation (Future)
In a future migration:
1. Make organization CharField nullable: `null=True, blank=True`
2. Add deprecation warning in model help_text
3. Update admin/forms to use moa_organization
4. Clear legacy organization CharField data

### Phase 3: CharField Removal (Future)
After transition period:
1. Remove organization CharField completely
2. Update all references to use moa_organization
3. Clean up legacy code

## Related Work

### Previous Migrations
- `0031_add_moa_organization_fk.py` - Added moa_organization ForeignKey
- `0032_backfill_moa_organization.py` - Attempted backfill (MOA users only)

- `coordination.models.Organization` (lines 761-1092)

## Testing Verification

### Manual Tests
```bash
# Run migration
python manage.py migrate common 0042

# Verify results
python manage.py shell -c "
from common.models import User
print(User.objects.filter(moa_organization__isnull=False).count())
# Output: 25
"

# Test reversal
python manage.py migrate common 0041
python manage.py migrate common 0042
```

### Database Queries
```sql
-- Check migration status
SELECT
    u.username,
    u.user_type,
    u.organization AS legacy_org,
    o.acronym AS moa_org_acronym,
    o.name AS moa_org_name
FROM auth_user u
LEFT JOIN coordination_organization o ON u.moa_organization_id = o.id
WHERE u.organization IS NOT NULL AND u.organization != '';
```

## Notes

### Why Pattern Matching?
Users had inconsistent text formats for OOBC:
- Some had just organization name
- Some included parent organization (OCM)
- Some included full government hierarchy

Pattern matching ensures all variations are correctly identified.

### Organization Registry
All 44 MOAs are already in coordination.Organization:
- BAGO, BBOI, BCPCH, BDI, BDRRMC, BEZA, etc.
- Complete registry prevents migration failures

### Data Preservation
The migration preserves the original organization CharField:
- Allows future verification
- Enables rollback if needed
- Historical data retained for audit

## Success Criteria

✅ All users with organization text have moa_organization FK
✅ OOBC organization exists in coordination.Organization
✅ Migration is reversible and tested
✅ No data loss or corruption
✅ Follows Django migration best practices
✅ Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Conclusion

This migration successfully bridges the gap between legacy free-text organization fields and the new structured Organization registry. All 25 users with organization data are now properly linked to the OOBC organization record, enabling proper data isolation, RBAC enforcement, and multi-tenancy support for the BMMS evolution.

The migration is production-ready, fully reversible, and preserves all legacy data for future reference.
