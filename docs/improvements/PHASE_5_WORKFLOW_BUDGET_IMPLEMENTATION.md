# Phase 5: Project Workflow Management + Budget Approval System

**Implementation Date**: October 2, 2025
**Status**: COMPLETE
**Priority**: HIGH
**Dependencies**: Phase 4 (Portfolio Dashboard) - COMPLETE

---

## Overview

Phase 5 implements two critical features for the OOBC Management System:

1. **Workflow Detail Page**: Visual 9-stage project lifecycle tracking
2. **Budget Approval Dashboard**: 5-stage budget approval process with HTMX interactions

---

## Deliverables

### 1. Workflow Detail Page (`/oobc-management/project-central/projects/<uuid:workflow_id>/`)

#### Features Implemented

- **Visual 9-Stage Timeline**: Horizontal progress bar with stage nodes
  - Need Identification
  - Need Validation
  - Policy Linkage

  - Stage-specific icons (FontAwesome)
  - Color-coded stage status (completed: green, current: blue with pulse animation, pending: gray)

- **Stage Advancement**:
  - Form to advance workflow to next stage
  - Notes field for documenting stage completion
  - Validation to prevent skipping stages
  - Final stage detection

- **Project Details Card**:
  - Linked Need and PPA
  - Budget allocation (if PPA exists)

  - Chronological list of completed stages
  - User who completed each stage
  - Timestamp and notes

- **Related Tasks & Alerts**:
  - Display up to 5 related tasks with status
  - Active alerts for the workflow
  - Links to detailed views

#### Files Modified/Created

**Views** (`src/project_central/views.py`):
```python
def project_workflow_detail(request, workflow_id)
    - Builds 9-stage data structure with status indicators
    - Calculates progress percentage
    - Retrieves history, tasks, and alerts

def advance_project_stage(request, workflow_id)
    - Validates stage advancement
    - Calls workflow.advance_stage() method
    - Prevents skipping stages
    - Shows success/error messages

def _get_stage_icon(stage_key)
    - Returns FontAwesome icon for each stage
```

**Template** (`src/templates/project_central/workflow_detail.html`):
- Horizontal 9-column grid layout
- Custom CSS for pulse animation on current stage
- Progress bar with animated width transition
- Two-column layout (main content + sidebar)
- Stage history with blue timeline markers
- Responsive design (col-md-8 + col-md-4)

**URLs** (`src/project_central/urls.py`):
```python
path('projects/<uuid:workflow_id>/', views.project_workflow_detail, name='project_workflow_detail')
path('projects/<uuid:workflow_id>/advance/', views.advance_project_stage, name='advance_project_stage')
```

### 2. Budget Approval Dashboard (`/oobc-management/project-central/approvals/`)

#### Features Implemented

- **5-Stage Approval Counts**:
  - Draft
  - Technical Review
  - Budget Review
  - Stakeholder Consultation
  - Executive Approval
  - Approved (completed stage)

- **Pending Approvals Table**:
  - PPA title and budget
  - Sector badge
  - Current approval stage badge (color-coded)
  - HTMX action buttons (Approve, Reject)

- **Recent Activity Tabs**:
  - Recently Approved PPAs (last 10)
  - Recently Rejected PPAs (last 5)
  - Tabbed interface with Bootstrap tabs

- **HTMX Interactions**:
  - Approve button: advances to next approval stage
  - Reject button: prompts for reason (via JavaScript)
  - Instant row updates without page reload
  - Confirmation dialogs before actions
  - Page reload after 1 second to update counts

#### Files Modified/Created

**Views** (`src/project_central/views.py`):
```python
def budget_approval_dashboard(request)
    - Builds approval_counts dictionary for all 8 stages
    - Queries pending_approvals (in review stages)
    - Retrieves recently_approved and recently_rejected PPAs

# Note: approve_budget and reject_budget views already existed
```

**Template** (`src/templates/project_central/budget_approval_dashboard.html`):
- 6-column grid for stage counts (with hover effects)
- Summary metrics cards (pending, approved, rejected)
- Pending approvals table with HTMX attributes
- Bootstrap tabs for recent activity
- HTMX.js integration (v1.9.10)
- JavaScript event handlers for approval confirmations

**HTMX Attributes Used**:
```html
hx-post="{% url 'project_central:approve_budget' ppa.id %}"
hx-target="closest tr"
hx-swap="outerHTML swap:300ms"
hx-confirm="Approve this PPA and advance to next stage?"
```

**JavaScript Integration**:
- `htmx:afterSwap` listener to reload page after approval
- `htmx:confirm` listener for rejection reason prompt
- 1-second delay before page reload (allows user to see success feedback)

**URLs** (already existed):
```python
path('approvals/', views.budget_approval_dashboard, name='budget_approval_dashboard')
path('approvals/<int:ppa_id>/review/', views.review_budget_approval, name='review_budget_approval')
path('approvals/<int:ppa_id>/approve/', views.approve_budget, name='approve_budget')
path('approvals/<int:ppa_id>/reject/', views.reject_budget, name='reject_budget')
```

## Technical Details

### Models Used

**ProjectWorkflow** (`project_central/models.py`):
- 9 WORKFLOW_STAGES choices
- `current_stage` field with db_index
- `stage_history` JSONField for tracking transitions
- `advance_stage(new_stage, user, notes)` method
- `can_advance_to_stage(new_stage)` validation
- `get_stage_progress_percentage()` calculation

**MonitoringEntry** (`monitoring/models.py`):
- 8 APPROVAL_STATUS_CHOICES
- `approval_status` field (draft, technical_review, budget_review, stakeholder_consultation, executive_approval, approved, enacted, rejected)

**BudgetApprovalStage** (`project_central/models.py`):
- Tracks individual approval stage instances
- ForeignKey to MonitoringEntry (PPA)
- Stage, status, approver, approved_at, comments fields
- Methods: `approve()`, `reject()`, `return_for_revision()`

### Styling & UX

**Workflow Detail Page**:
- Progress bar: 4px height, emerald gradient fill with 0.8s transition
- Stage nodes: 60px circles, completed (green), current (blue with pulse), pending (gray)
- Pulse animation: 2s infinite cycle, box-shadow expansion
- History items: 3px blue left border, circular timeline markers

**Budget Approval Dashboard**:
- Stage count cards: 2.5rem font-size, hover transform (-2px Y-axis)
- Color scheme:
  - Draft: Gray (#6b7280)
  - Technical Review: Blue (#3b82f6)
  - Budget Review: Purple (#8b5cf6)
  - Stakeholder Consultation: Orange (#f59e0b)
  - Executive Approval: Emerald (#10b981)
  - Approved: Green (#059669)
- Row transitions: all 0.2s, hover background change

### Accessibility

- ARIA labels on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support
- Proper focus management
- Color-blind friendly color schemes (sufficient contrast)
- Screen reader friendly markup
- Touch targets minimum 44x44px (buttons)

### Performance

- Database queries optimized with select_related for ForeignKeys
- Progress bar calculated on-demand (no extra DB queries)
- Stage history stored as JSONField (single DB column)
- HTMX reduces full page reloads
- CSS animations use GPU-accelerated transforms

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations

1. **No HTMX for Workflow Advancement**:
   - Workflow stage advancement uses full page POST (no HTMX)
   - Future: Implement HTMX swap for seamless advancement

2. **Budget Approval Reason**:
   - Rejection reason uses JavaScript `prompt()` (not ideal UX)
   - Future: Implement modal form for rejection with proper validation

3. **Stage History Formatting**:
   - Stage history stores raw stage keys (e.g., "need_identification")
   - Future: Store display names for better readability

### Recommended Enhancements

1. **Workflow Gantt Chart**:
   - Add visual Gantt chart showing timeline of all stages
   - Use Chart.js or similar library

2. **Approval Analytics**:
   - Average approval time per stage
   - Bottleneck detection (stages with longest wait times)
   - Approval rate metrics

3. **Bulk Approval Actions**:
   - Allow approving multiple PPAs at once
   - Bulk rejection with shared reason

4. **Email Notifications**:
   - Send email when workflow advances
   - Notify approvers when PPA enters their review stage

5. **Approval Comments Thread**:
   - Display all reviewer comments in a timeline
   - Allow inline replies
