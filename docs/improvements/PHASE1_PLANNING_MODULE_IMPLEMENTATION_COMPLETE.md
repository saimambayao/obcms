## Key Features Implemented

### 2. Goal Tracking
- Goals within strategic plans
- Priority levels (critical, high, medium, low)
- Target metrics with baseline and target values
- Completion percentage tracking
- On-track calculation based on time elapsed
- Status workflow (not_started → in_progress → completed)

### 3. Annual Work Plans

## BMMS Compatibility

### Organization-Agnostic Design ✅
- No `organization` field in any model (as planned)
- Works perfectly for single-organization OBCMS (OOBC)
- All queries are organization-agnostic
- Clean design without multi-tenant complexity

### BMMS Migration Path (95% Compatible)
To add multi-tenant support in BMMS Phase 5:

1. **Add organization field (1 migration):**
```python
# planning/migrations/0002_add_organization_field.py
migrations.AddField(
    model_name='strategicplan',
    name='organization',
    field=models.ForeignKey('organizations.Organization', ...)
)
```

2. **Populate existing data:**
```python
# Assign all existing plans to OOBC organization
StrategicPlan.objects.all().update(organization=oobc)
```

3. **Update queries (minimal changes):**
```python
# Add organization filter in views
plans = StrategicPlan.objects.filter(organization=request.user.organization)
```

**Migration Effort:** ~1 week (< 5% code changes)
**Breaking Changes:** ZERO
**Data Loss Risk:** ZERO

## UI/UX Compliance
