# Organization Middleware Implementation

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Phase:** BMMS Phase 1 - Foundation
**Created:** 2025-10-13
**Priority:** CRITICAL

---

## Overview

Implemented comprehensive `OrganizationMiddleware` for BMMS multi-tenant request handling. This middleware provides organization-based data isolation for all 44 BARMM Ministries, Offices, and Agencies (MOAs).

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created

1. **`src/common/middleware/organization.py`** - Complete middleware implementation
2. **This documentation file** - Usage and security guidelines

### Key Features

✅ **URL Pattern Extraction** - Extracts organization from `/moa/<ORG_CODE>/...` URLs
✅ **Request Organization** - Sets `request.organization` on every request
✅ **Access Control** - Enforces role-based organization access
✅ **Thread-Local Storage** - Enables QuerySet-level filtering
✅ **Superuser Support** - Full access to all organizations
✅ **OCM Support** - Read-only aggregation access for Office of Chief Minister
✅ **OOBC Staff Support** - Organization switching for operations staff
✅ **MOA Staff Support** - Restricted to assigned organization
✅ **Graceful Fallback** - Falls back to user's primary organization
✅ **Security Logging** - All access attempts logged for audit
✅ **Future-Proof** - Ready for OrganizationMembership model

---

## Architecture

### Organization Extraction

The middleware extracts organization from multiple sources (priority order):

1. **URL Pattern** (highest priority): `/moa/<ORG_CODE>/dashboard/`
2. **Query Parameter**: `?org=<ORG_CODE>`
3. **User Primary Organization** (fallback): `user.moa_organization`
4. **Session Storage** (lowest priority): `request.session['current_organization']`

### Access Control Model

| User Type | Access Level | Can Switch Orgs |
|-----------|--------------|-----------------|
| Superuser | All organizations | ✅ Yes |
| OCM User | All organizations (read-only) | ✅ Yes |
| OOBC Staff | All organizations | ✅ Yes |
| MOA Staff | Their organization only | ❌ No |
| Guest | None | ❌ No |

### Thread-Local Storage

Organization context stored in thread-local variable for:
- **QuerySet Filtering** - Model managers can access current organization
- **Template Context** - Templates can access organization context
- **Background Tasks** - Celery tasks can maintain organization isolation
- **API Requests** - DRF views can filter by organization

---

## Installation

### 1. Register Middleware

Add to `src/obc_management/settings/base.py` **AFTER** `AuthenticationMiddleware`:

```python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    "django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware",
    "whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware",
    "common.middleware.DeprecatedURLRedirectMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware",
    "corsheaders.middleware.CorsMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware",
    "django.middleware.csrf.CsrfViewMiddleware",
    "django.contrib.auth.middleware.AuthenticationMiddleware",
    "axes.middleware.AxesMiddleware",
    "auditlog.middleware.AuditlogMiddleware",

    # ADD THIS LINE - Organization context middleware
    "common.middleware.organization.OrganizationMiddleware",  # ⭐ NEW

    "common.middleware.AuditMiddleware",
    "common.middleware.APILoggingMiddleware",
    # ... rest of middleware
]
```

**⚠️ CRITICAL:** Must be placed **AFTER** `AuthenticationMiddleware` to access `request.user`.

### 2. Configure RBAC Settings

Already configured in `base.py`:

```python
RBAC_SETTINGS = {
    'ENABLE_MULTI_TENANT': True,
    'OCM_ORGANIZATION_CODE': 'ocm',
    'CACHE_TIMEOUT': 300,
    'ALLOW_ORGANIZATION_SWITCHING': True,
    'SESSION_ORG_KEY': 'current_organization',
}
```

### 3. Update Existing Middleware

The existing `common/middleware/organization_context.py` can remain for backward compatibility, or you can replace the import in `__init__.py`:

**Option A: Replace (Recommended)**

```python
# src/common/middleware/__init__.py
from .organization import OrganizationMiddleware as OrganizationContextMiddleware
```

**Option B: Keep Both (Transition Period)**

Keep both middlewares during transition, then remove old one after verification.

## Usage Guide

### In Views

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from planning.models import PPA

def ppa_list(request):
    """List PPAs for current organization."""

    # Organization automatically set by middleware
    org = request.organization

    if not org:
        # Handle no organization context
        return render(request, 'error/no_organization.html')

    # Filter by organization
    ppas = PPA.objects.filter(implementing_moa=org)

    # Check if user can switch organizations
    can_switch = request.can_switch_org

    # Check if OCM user (read-only aggregation)
    is_ocm = request.is_ocm_user

    return render(request, 'planning/ppa_list.html', {
        'organization': org,
        'ppas': ppas,
        'can_switch_org': can_switch,
        'is_ocm_user': is_ocm,
    })
```

### With Decorators

```python
from common.middleware.organization import (
    requires_organization,
    requires_organization_access
)

@requires_organization
def dashboard(request):
    """Dashboard view - organization context required."""
    # request.organization is guaranteed to exist
    org = request.organization
    return render(request, 'dashboard.html', {'organization': org})

@requires_organization_access
def sensitive_view(request):
    """Sensitive view - verified access required."""
    # User access to organization is verified
    # 403 Forbidden raised if user lacks access
    org = request.organization
    return render(request, 'sensitive.html', {'organization': org})
```

### In Templates

```html
{% if request.organization %}
    <h1>{{ request.organization.name }}</h1>
    <p>{{ request.organization.acronym }}</p>
{% endif %}

{% if request.can_switch_org %}
    <a href="{% url 'organization_switch' %}">Switch Organization</a>
{% endif %}

{% if request.is_ocm_user %}
    <div class="alert alert-info">
        OCM View: Read-only aggregation access
    </div>
{% endif %}
```

### In Models (QuerySet Filtering)

```python
from django.db import models
from common.middleware.organization import get_current_organization

class OrganizationScopedManager(models.Manager):
    """Manager that automatically filters by current organization."""

    def get_queryset(self):
        qs = super().get_queryset()
        org = get_current_organization()

        if org:
            return qs.filter(moa_organization=org)

        return qs

class PPA(models.Model):
    """Program/Project/Activity model."""

    name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    implementing_moa = models.ForeignKey(
        'coordination.Organization',
        on_delete=models.PROTECT
    )

    # Use organization-scoped manager
    objects = OrganizationScopedManager()
    all_objects = models.Manager()  # Unfiltered access
```

### In API Views (DRF)

```python
from rest_framework import viewsets
from rest_framework.permissions import IsAuthenticated

class PPAViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    """PPA API ViewSet with organization filtering."""

    permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]

    def get_queryset(self):
        # Organization automatically available
        org = self.request.organization

        if not org:
            return PPA.objects.none()

        # OCM users can see all
        if self.request.is_ocm_user:
            return PPA.objects.all()

        # Others filtered by organization
        return PPA.objects.filter(implementing_moa=org)
```

---

## Security Considerations

### Access Control

1. **URL-Based Organization** - Organization extracted from URL is validated
2. **Permission Verification** - User access checked before setting organization
3. **403 Forbidden** - Returned if user lacks access to requested organization
4. **Security Logging** - All access attempts logged for audit trail

### Data Isolation

1. **MOA Staff Isolation** - MOA staff can ONLY access their organization
2. **QuerySet Filtering** - Automatic filtering via thread-local storage
3. **Template Context** - Organization available in all templates
4. **API Isolation** - DRF views auto-filtered by organization

### Special Access

1. **Superusers** - Unrestricted access to all organizations
2. **OCM Users** - Read-only access to all organizations (oversight)
3. **OOBC Staff** - Can switch between organizations (operations)

### Thread Safety

- **Thread-Local Storage** - Safe for WSGI/ASGI servers
- **Request Lifecycle** - Cleaned up after each request
- **No Leakage** - Previous request's organization never persists

---

## Testing

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Start development server
cd src/
python manage.py runserver

# Test URLs:
# 1. Valid organization
http://localhost:8000/moa/oobc/dashboard/

# 2. Invalid organization (should 404)
http://localhost:8000/moa/invalid-org/dashboard/

# 3. No access (should fallback or error)
# Login as MOA staff, try different organization

# 4. OCM access (should work for all orgs)
# Login as OCM user, try any organization

# 5. Superuser (should work for all orgs)
# Login as superuser, try any organization
```

### Unit Testing

```python
from django.test import TestCase, RequestFactory
from django.contrib.auth import get_user_model
from common.middleware.organization import OrganizationMiddleware
from coordination.models import Organization

User = get_user_model()

class OrganizationMiddlewareTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.factory = RequestFactory()
        self.middleware = OrganizationMiddleware(lambda r: None)

        # Create test organization
        self.org = Organization.objects.create(
            name="Test Ministry",
            acronym="test-ministry",
            organization_type="bmoa"
        )

        # Create test user
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(
            username="testuser",
            password="testpass123"
        )

    def test_extract_org_from_url(self):
        """Test organization extraction from URL."""
        request = self.factory.get('/moa/test-ministry/dashboard/')
        request.user = self.user

        org = self.middleware._get_organization_from_request(request)
        self.assertEqual(org, self.org)

    def test_superuser_access(self):
        """Test superuser has access to all organizations."""
        self.user.is_superuser = True
        self.user.save()

        request = self.factory.get('/moa/test-ministry/dashboard/')
        request.user = self.user

        org = self.middleware._get_organization_from_request(request)
        self.assertEqual(org, self.org)

    def test_moa_staff_restricted(self):
        """Test MOA staff restricted to their organization."""
        self.user.is_moa_staff = True
        self.user.moa_organization = self.org
        self.user.save()

        request = self.factory.get('/moa/test-ministry/dashboard/')
        request.user = self.user

        org = self.middleware._get_organization_from_request(request)
        self.assertEqual(org, self.org)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Organization not set on request

**Symptom:** `request.organization` is None

**Solutions:**
1. Verify middleware is registered in settings
2. Check middleware order (must be after AuthenticationMiddleware)
3. Ensure user is authenticated
4. Verify URL pattern matches `/moa/<ORG_CODE>/`
5. Check organization exists and is active

### Issue: Access denied (403 Forbidden)

**Symptom:** User gets 403 error when accessing organization

**Solutions:**
1. Verify user has correct role (is_moa_staff, is_oobc_staff, etc.)
2. Check user's moa_organization is set correctly
3. Verify organization acronym matches URL
4. Review security logs for access attempt details

### Issue: Thread-local not cleared

**Symptom:** Organization context persists between requests

**Solutions:**
1. Verify middleware is completing request cycle
2. Check no exceptions preventing cleanup
3. Review `clear_current_organization()` is called
4. Test in isolated environment

### Issue: QuerySet filtering not working

**Symptom:** Data from other organizations visible

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure `get_current_organization()` is called in manager
2. Verify thread-local storage is set
3. Check manager is using organization filter
4. Review model's default manager

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries

- **Organization Lookup:** Cached by Django's query cache
- **Access Check:** Single database query per request
- **Membership Check:** Only when OrganizationMembership exists

### Thread-Local Storage

- **Minimal Overhead:** Simple attribute assignment
- **No Locking:** Python GIL handles thread safety
- **Fast Access:** Direct attribute lookup

### Caching Opportunities

Future optimization:
- Cache user's organization memberships
- Cache organization access permissions
- Use Redis for cross-request caching
