# WorkItem Enterprise Enhancements: Feature Gap Analysis & Enhancement Roadmap

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Status:** PROPOSED
**Priority:** STRATEGIC PLANNING

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of missing enterprise-grade project portfolio management (PPM) features in the OBCMS WorkItem system, based on the [Unified PM Research Document](../research/obcms_unified_pm_research.md). The analysis compares OBCMS WorkItem against enterprise PM software (Jira, Asana, Smartsheet) and identifies 18 critical feature gaps across 6 domains:

1. **Resource Management** (5 features)
2. **Financial Tracking** (3 features)
3. **Risk Management** (2 features)
4. **Dependency Management** (2 features)
5. **Time Tracking** (2 features)
6. **Portfolio Governance** (4 features)

This roadmap proposes 5 enhancement phases that would transform OBCMS WorkItem from a basic work tracking system into a government-grade Enterprise Project Portfolio Management (EPPM) platform suitable for BARMM's digital transformation initiatives.

2. **No Budget/Cost Tracking** - Can't track planned vs actual costs, budget allocation
3. **No Time Tracking** - Can't log hours worked, estimated vs actual effort
4. **No Risk Register** - Can't identify, assess, or mitigate project risks
5. **No Critical Path Analysis** - Can't identify scheduling bottlenecks
6. **No Earned Value Management (EVM)** - Can't measure project performance objectively
7. **No Portfolio Dashboards** - No executive-level portfolio analytics
8. **No Workload Balancing** - Can't visualize or optimize team utilization
9. **No Change Request Tracking** - Can't manage scope changes formally
10. **No Milestone Tracking** - No first-class milestone support
11. **No Baseline Comparison** - Can't track variance from original plan
12. **No Resource Forecasting** - Can't predict future resource needs
