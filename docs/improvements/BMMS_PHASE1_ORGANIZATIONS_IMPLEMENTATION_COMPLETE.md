### 3. Management Command

#### `/src/organizations/management/commands/seed_organizations.py`
**Purpose:** Idempotent command to seed or re-seed organizations

**Features:**
- ✅ Idempotent: Can run multiple times safely
- ✅ Create missing organizations
- ✅ Update existing organizations
- ✅ `--force` flag to delete all and re-create (with confirmation)
- ✅ Detailed progress output
- ✅ Statistics and verification

**Usage:**
```bash
# Normal mode (create missing, update existing)
python manage.py seed_organizations

# Force mode (delete all and re-create)
python manage.py seed_organizations --force
```

---

## How to Apply These Migrations

### Step 1: Verify Organizations App is Registered

Check that `organizations` is in `INSTALLED_APPS`:

```python
# src/obc_management/settings/base.py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... other apps ...
    'common',
    'organizations',  # <-- MUST BE HERE
    'communities',
    # ... rest of apps ...
]
```

### Step 2: Run Migrations

```bash
cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/BTA/OOBC/obcms/src

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate organizations

# Expected output:
# Running migrations:
#   Applying organizations.0001_initial... OK
#   Applying organizations.0002_seed_barmm_organizations... OK
```

### Step 3: Verify Organizations Were Created

```bash
# Check count
python manage.py shell
>>> from organizations.models import Organization
>>> Organization.objects.count()
44

# Verify OOBC is ID=1
>>> Organization.objects.get(code='OOBC')
<Organization: OOBC - Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities>
>>> Organization.objects.get(code='OOBC').id
1

# Check pilot MOAs
>>> Organization.objects.filter(is_pilot=True).values_list('code', 'name')
<QuerySet [('MAFAR', 'Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform'),
           ('MOH', 'Ministry of Health'),
           ('MOLE', 'Ministry of Labor and Employment')]>
>>> Organization.objects.filter(is_pilot=True).count()
3
```

### Step 4: (Optional) Re-seed Using Management Command

```bash
# If you need to re-seed (idempotent)
python manage.py seed_organizations

# Output will show:
# ✅ BARMM MOA Seeding Complete!
# Total Organizations: 44 (expected: 44)
# Created: 0
# Updated: 44
# Pilot MOAs: 3 (expected: 3)
# ✅ OOBC Organization ID: 1 (correct - must be 1)
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1 Completion)
1. ✅ Register organizations app in settings (if not already done)
2. ✅ Run migrations
3. ✅ Verify organization count and OOBC ID
4. ⏭️ Implement OrganizationMiddleware (separate task)
5. ⏭️ Create admin interface
6. ⏭️ Add UI components (organization switcher)

### Phase 2: Planning Module (Depends on Phase 1)
After Organizations app is complete:
- Strategic Planning module
- Annual Work Plans
- Organization-scoped planning data
- Foundation for budgeting

**See:** `/docs/plans/bmms/tasks/phase2_planning_module.txt`

---

## Critical Implementation Notes

### OOBC ID=1 Requirement
**WHY:** All existing OBCMS data will be assigned to OOBC (organization_id=1) when models are migrated to add organization scoping. If OOBC is not ID=1, we need to update all foreign keys, which is risky.

**SOLUTION:** Create OOBC FIRST in the data migration before any other organization. This ensures it gets auto-increment ID=1.

### Module Flags Default to True
All organizations have all modules enabled by default. Individual MOAs can disable modules they don't need via admin interface or management commands.

### Pilot MOAs
Three MOAs are marked as pilots:
- **MOH** (Ministry of Health)
- **MOLE** (Ministry of Labor and Employment)
- **MAFAR** (Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform)

These will be the first MOAs onboarded after OOBC (Phases 7-8).

### Thread-Local Storage
The OrganizationScopedModel uses thread-local storage to track the current organization. This is:
- ✅ Safe for WSGI servers (Gunicorn, uWSGI)
- ✅ Safe for ASGI servers (Uvicorn, Daphne)
- ✅ Cleaned up by middleware after each request

---

## Model Relationships

```
User ←─┬─→ OrganizationMembership ←─→ Organization
       │                                      ↓
       └──────────────────────────→ (primary_focal_person)

Organization ──→ Region (primary_region)
             └─→ Municipality (service_areas M2M)

OrganizationScopedModel (Abstract)
        ↓
    [All future models that need org scoping inherit from this]
```

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (To Be Created)
- Organization model creation
- OrganizationMembership validation
- Unique constraints
- Pilot MOA filtering

### Integration Tests (To Be Created)
- OrganizationScopedManager filtering
- Thread-local storage
- Middleware integration
- Data isolation

### Data Integrity Tests
- Verify OOBC ID=1 after migration
- Verify 44 organizations created
- Verify 3 pilot MOAs flagged
- Verify org_type distribution

---

## Rollback Procedure

If needed, rollback the migrations:

```bash
# Rollback data migration only (keeps tables)
python manage.py migrate organizations 0001_initial

# This will remove all 44 organizations
# Tables remain intact

# To completely rollback (DANGEROUS - removes tables)
python manage.py migrate organizations zero

# This will:
# - Drop organizations_organization table
# - Drop organizations_organizationmembership table
# - Drop M2M table
```

**WARNING:** Only rollback if absolutely necessary. Rolling back after other apps depend on organizations will cause foreign key errors.

---

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created
- `organizations_organization.code` (unique, indexed)
- `organizations_organization.(org_type, is_active)` (composite)
- `organizations_organization.is_pilot` (indexed)
- `organizations_organizationmembership.(user, is_primary)` (composite)
- `organizations_organizationmembership.(organization, role)` (composite)
- `organizations_organizationmembership.(user, organization)` (composite)

### Query Optimization
- Use `select_related('organization')` for foreign key lookups
- Use `prefetch_related('organization_memberships')` for reverse relationships
- OrganizationScopedManager auto-filters reduce query result sets

---

## Security Implications

### Data Isolation
- Organization data is automatically scoped by OrganizationMiddleware
- Users can only access organizations they are members of
- Superusers can access all organizations (for admin/OCM)

### Access Control
- OrganizationMembership.role determines permissions
- OrganizationMembership.is_primary identifies default organization
- OrganizationMembership.can_* permissions control specific actions

---

## Dependencies

### Required Apps
- ✅ `common` (for Region and Municipality models)
- ✅ `auth` (for User model)

### Required Python Packages
- Django >= 4.0 (for JSONField)
- No additional packages required
