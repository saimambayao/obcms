## Remaining Phases

### Phase 4: Auto-Registration from Contacts ⏳ PENDING

**Files to Create:**
1. `src/coordination/signals.py` - Signal handlers
   - `@receiver(post_save, sender=OrganizationContact)`
   - Auto-create user accounts from contacts
   - Generate secure passwords (12+ chars)
   - Send welcome emails with credentials

**Files to Modify:**
2. `src/coordination/apps.py` - Register signals

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `secrets` module for password generation
- Email must include temporary password and password reset link
- Only create users for contacts with MOA organization types

---

### Phase 5: Work Item Filtering ⏳ PENDING

**Files to Modify:**
1. `src/common/forms/work_items.py` - WorkItemForm
   - Detect MOA vs OOBC context from related PPA
   - Filter assignees by context:
     - MOA PPAs → Show only MOA staff (`user_type__in=['bmoa', 'lgu', 'nga']`)
     - OOBC → Show OOBC staff with priority ordering
   - Handle teams field:
     - MOA PPAs → Set queryset to none with help text
     - OOBC → Keep existing queryset

**Implementation Notes:**
- Check `ppa_category` or `related_ppa` to determine context
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing work items
- Update all work item creation views to pass PPA context

## Architecture Decisions

### Why Separate MOA Registration Form?
- **Clear user intent**: MOA staff have different requirements
- **Simplified validation**: Only MOA user types shown
- **Targeted communication**: Email templates specific to MOA
- **Future extensibility**: Can add MOA-specific fields

### Why Group-Based Permissions?
- **Scalability**: Easy to add/remove approvers
- **Audit trail**: Clear permission assignments
- **Flexibility**: Can assign to non-executives
- **Django standard**: Uses built-in permission system

### Why Email Notifications?
- **User experience**: Clear communication
- **Compliance**: Audit trail of all actions
- **Transparency**: Users know approval status
- **Support**: Reduces "why can't I login?" tickets

### Why HTMX for Approvals?
- **Instant feedback**: No page reload
- **Modern UX**: Smooth animations
- **Progressive enhancement**: Works without JS
- **Consistent**: Matches OBCMS UI standards
