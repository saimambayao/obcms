## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Action → View → Form Validation → Service Layer → Model Validation → Database
                                                     ↓
                                                DB Constraints
                                                     ↓
                                              PostgreSQL Triggers
```

### Service Layer Usage
All financial operations use `AllotmentReleaseService`:

**Allotment Release:**
```python
service = AllotmentReleaseService()
allotment = service.release_allotment(
    program_budget=program_budget,
    quarter=quarter,
    amount=amount,
    created_by=request.user,
    release_date=date.today()
)
```

**Obligation Creation:**
```python
obligation = service.create_obligation(
    allotment=allotment,
    description=description,
    amount=amount,
    obligated_date=date.today(),
    created_by=request.user
)
```

**Disbursement Recording:**
```python
disbursement = service.record_disbursement(
    obligation=obligation,
    amount=amount,
    disbursed_date=date.today(),
    payee=payee,
    payment_method=payment_method,
    created_by=request.user
)
```

### URL Structure
```
/budget/execution/                     → Dashboard
/budget/execution/allotments/          → List allotments
/budget/execution/allotments/<uuid>/   → Allotment detail
/budget/execution/allotments/release/  → Release allotment
/budget/execution/obligations/         → List obligations
/budget/execution/obligations/<uuid>/  → Obligation detail
/budget/execution/obligations/create/  → Create obligation
/budget/execution/disbursements/       → List disbursements
/budget/execution/disbursements/<uuid>/ → Disbursement detail
/budget/execution/disbursements/record/ → Record payment
```

## Permission System

### Role Hierarchy
1. **Finance Directors** (Highest)
   - Approve allotments
   - Override budget constraints (with justification)
   - Full access to reports

2. **Budget Officers**
   - Release allotments
   - Create obligations
   - Record disbursements

3. **Finance Staff**
   - Create obligations
   - Record disbursements
   - View reports

4. **Disbursement Officers**
   - Record disbursements only

### Decorator Usage
```python
@login_required
@budget_officer_required
def allotment_release(request):
    # Only budget officers can access
    ...

@login_required
@finance_staff_required
def obligation_create(request):
    # Finance staff and above
    ...
```

## HTMX Integration

### Real-Time Widgets
All dashboard widgets auto-refresh:

**Recent Transactions:**
```html
<div id="recent-transactions"
     hx-get="{% url 'budget_execution:recent_transactions' %}"
     hx-trigger="load, every 30s"
     hx-swap="innerHTML">
```

**Pending Approvals:**
```html
<div id="pending-approvals"
     hx-get="{% url 'budget_execution:pending_approvals' %}"
     hx-trigger="load, every 30s"
     hx-swap="innerHTML">
```

**Budget Alerts:**
```html
<div id="budget-alerts"
     hx-get="{% url 'budget_execution:budget_alerts' %}"
     hx-trigger="load, every 60s"
     hx-swap="innerHTML">
```

### Form Enhancement
Forms use HTMX for instant feedback:
```html
<select name="program_budget"
        hx-get="/budget/execution/ajax/budget-details/"
        hx-target="#budget-info"
        hx-trigger="change">
```

## Validation Layers

### 1. Frontend Validation
- HTML5 input types (date, number)
- Required field enforcement
- Client-side format checking

### 2. Django Form Validation
```python
def clean(self):
    # Check available balance
    if total_obligated > allotment.amount:
        raise ValidationError(
            f"Total obligations would exceed allotment balance"
        )
```

### 3. Model Validation
```python
def clean(self):
    # Verify budget constraints
    if total_allotted > approved_amount:
        raise ValidationError(
            "Total allotments exceed approved budget"
        )
```

### 4. Database Constraints
```python
constraints = [
    models.CheckConstraint(
        check=models.Q(amount__gte=Decimal('0.01')),
        name='allotment_positive_amount'
    )
]
```

### 5. PostgreSQL Triggers
Real-time balance validation at database level (not yet implemented but architecture supports it).

## Financial Constraint Enforcement

### Parliament Bill No. 325 Compliance

**Section 78 Requirements:**
1. ✅ Allotments ≤ Approved Budget
2. ✅ Obligations ≤ Allotment Balance
3. ✅ Disbursements ≤ Obligation Balance
4. ✅ Audit trail for all transactions
5. ✅ Status tracking for each stage

**Implementation:**
```python
# Triple-layer validation prevents overallocation
Approved Budget (₱100M)
  ├─ Q1 Allotment (₱25M) ✓
  ├─ Q2 Allotment (₱25M) ✓
  ├─ Q3 Allotment (₱25M) ✓
  └─ Q4 Allotment (₱30M) ✗ Would exceed approved amount
```

## Dashboard Features

### Fiscal Year Summary
- **Approved Budget** - Total approved amount
- **Allotted** - Released allotments with % of approved
- **Obligated** - Committed obligations with % of allotted
- **Disbursed** - Actual payments with % of obligated

### Quarterly Execution Chart
Chart.js visualization showing:
- Allotted amounts per quarter
- Obligated amounts per quarter
- Disbursed amounts per quarter

### Program-Wise Utilization
Table showing each program's:

- Utilization percentage
- Progress bar visualization

### Real-Time Monitoring
- **Recent Transactions** (last 30 days)
- **Pending Approvals** (awaiting finance director review)
- **Budget Alerts** (allotments >85% utilized)
