## Key Decisions Made

### âœ… Architectural Decisions

1. **User-Organization Linking:** Add `moa_organization` ForeignKey to User model (requires migration)
   - **Alternative Rejected:** Use CharField matching (fragile, error-prone)

2. **Permission Enforcement:** Defense-in-depth (view, model, template layers)
   - **Rationale:** Security best practice - fail closed

3. **QuerySet Filtering:** Auto-filter by default using mixins
   - **Rationale:** Prevent data leakage, reduce developer burden

4. **Access Control Model:**
   - Tier 1: View-only (OBC communities, policy recommendations)
   - Tier 2: Full CRUD (own organization, own PPAs, work items)
   - Tier 3: No access (MANA, other MOAs, admin)

---

## Critical Implementation Notes

### Database Migration

**IMPORTANT:** The `moa_organization` backfill migration matches users to organizations by **name** (case-insensitive). This may result in **unmatched users** if:
- Organization name in `User.organization` doesn't match `Organization.name`
- Organization doesn't exist yet
- Typos in organization names

**Action Required:** After running migrations, review unmatched users and manually assign `moa_organization`.

### Security Considerations

1. **Always check permissions at ALL three layers:**
   - View (decorators)
   - Model (validation)
   - Template (conditional rendering)

2. **QuerySet filtering is NOT sufficient security:**
   - Developers might forget to apply filters
   - Direct model access bypasses filters
   - Always validate in model methods

3. **Audit logging is REQUIRED:**
   - Log all MOA user actions
   - Log permission denials
   - Review logs regularly for suspicious activity

## Testing Requirements

### Unit Test Coverage Targets

- **Permission decorators:** 100% coverage
- **Permission mixins:** 100% coverage
- **User model methods:** 100% coverage
- **Template tags:** 100% coverage

### Integration Test Scenarios

1. **MOA user can view OBC communities** (GET succeeds)
2. **MOA user cannot create OBC communities** (POST returns 403)
3. **MOA user can edit own organization** (PUT succeeds)
4. **MOA user cannot edit other MOA organization** (PUT returns 403)
5. **MOA user can create PPA** (POST succeeds)
6. **MOA user can edit own PPA** (PUT succeeds)
7. **MOA user cannot edit other MOA PPA** (PUT returns 403)
8. **MOA user cannot access MANA** (GET returns 403)
9. **MOA user can view policy recommendations for their MOA**
10. **MOA user cannot view policy recommendations for other MOAs**

### Security Test Scenarios

1. **Privilege escalation attempt:** MOA user tries to set `is_superuser=True`
2. **Organization hijacking:** MOA user tries to change `moa_organization`
3. **Cross-MOA access:** MOA user tries to edit PPA with direct URL manipulation
4. **User type escalation:** MOA user tries to change `user_type` to `oobc_staff`
5. **CSRF bypass attempt:** Submit form without CSRF token
6. **Session hijacking:** Test session security measures

## Known Issues & Risks

### Issue 1: Unmatched Users in Backfill

**Risk:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** MOA users won't have `moa_organization` assigned
**Mitigation:**
- Manual review after migration
- Admin interface to assign organizations
- User notification to contact admin

### Issue 2: Performance Overhead from QuerySet Filtering

**Risk:** LOW
**Impact:** Additional database queries for permission checks
**Mitigation:**
- Use `select_related('moa_organization')` in views
- Add database indexes on `implementing_moa`
- Monitor query performance in production

### Issue 3: UI Confusion for MOA Users

**Risk:** LOW
**Impact:** MOA users try to access unauthorized features
**Mitigation:**
- Clear permission denial messages
- Hide unauthorized UI elements
- Provide MOA user guide
- Training sessions

## Next Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Review design document** with OOBC stakeholders
2. **Obtain approval** for database migration
3. **Create development branch:** `feature/moa-rbac`
4. **Implement Phase 1:** Database migrations
5. **Test Phase 1** thoroughly before proceeding
6. **Proceed through phases sequentially**
7. **Security audit** before production deployment
