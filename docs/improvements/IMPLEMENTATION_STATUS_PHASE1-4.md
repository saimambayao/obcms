## 🛠️ Technical Debt & Known Issues

### Pending Templates (Low Priority)
- Budget feedback dashboard template
- Service feedback form template
- Transparency dashboard template

**Note:** Views are fully functional. Templates can be created using existing design patterns from Phase 2 dashboards. This is a cosmetic task, not a blocker.

### Recommended Before Production
1. **Performance Testing**
   - Load test voting endpoint (concurrent users)
   - Query performance profiling
   - Consider PostgreSQL migration (from SQLite)

2. **Security Hardening**
   - Rate limiting on voting endpoint
   - Enhanced IP fraud detection
   - CSRF token rotation

3. **User Acceptance Testing**
   - Community voting workflow
   - Feedback submission flow
   - Transparency dashboard comprehension
