# Regional MANA Implementation - Corrections Applied

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Issue Reported:** Discrepancy between plan document and actual implementation

---

## Issues Identified

### 1. **Workshop Count Error in Plan Document** ✅ FIXED
- **Error:** Plan document stated "six workshops" on line 13
- **Reality:** Implementation has 5 workshops (workshop_1 through workshop_5)
- **Fix Applied:** Updated `docs/improvements/regional_mana_workshop_redesign_plan.md` line 13 from "six workshops" to "five workshops"

### 2. **Participant Guide Workshop Visualization** ✅ FIXED
- **Error:** Guide showed abbreviated workshop list with "... (Workshops 3-5 follow the same pattern)"
- **Reality:** Should show all 5 workshops with actual titles from schema
- **Fix Applied:** Updated `docs/guidelines/participant_user_guide.md` to display all 5 workshops:
  - Workshop 1: Understanding the Community Context
  - Workshop 2: Community Aspirations and Priorities
  - Workshop 3: Community Collaboration and Empowerment
  - Workshop 4: Community Feedback on Existing Initiatives
  - Workshop 5: OBCs Needs, Challenges, Factors, and Outcomes

## Implementation Verification

### ✅ Correct Workshop Sequence (Verified)

**Code:** `src/mana/services/workshop_access.py:20-26`
```python
WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE = [
    "workshop_1",
    "workshop_2",
    "workshop_3",
    "workshop_4",
    "workshop_5",
]
```

**Schema:** `src/mana/data/workshop_questions_schema.json`
- Contains exactly 5 workshop definitions
- Workshop IDs match code sequence
- Questions align with actual community needs assessment

### ✅ Sequential Access Control (Verified Working)

**Logic:** `src/mana/services/workshop_access.py:32-58`

```python
def get_allowed_workshops(self, participant) -> List[str]:
    """
    Access model:
    - All previously completed workshops remain accessible for review
    - The participant's current workshop is unlocked for active editing
    - No other workshops are accessible until marked complete
    """
    completed = list(participant.completed_workshops or [])
    current = participant.current_workshop
    if not current:
        current = self.WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE[0]  # Default to workshop_1

    if current not in completed:
        completed.append(current)  # Add current to allowed list

    # Return workshops in sequence order
    return [w for w in self.WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE if w in completed]
```

**How It Works:**
1. **New Participant:**
   - `current_workshop = "workshop_1"`
   - `completed_workshops = []`
   - **Allowed:** `["workshop_1"]` only

2. **After Completing Workshop 1:**
   - `current_workshop = "workshop_2"` (auto-advanced)
   - `completed_workshops = ["workshop_1"]`
   - **Allowed:** `["workshop_1", "workshop_2"]` (can review workshop_1, work on workshop_2)

3. **After Completing Workshop 2:**
   - `current_workshop = "workshop_3"`
   - `completed_workshops = ["workshop_1", "workshop_2"]`
   - **Allowed:** `["workshop_1", "workshop_2", "workshop_3"]`

4. **After Completing All 5:**
   - `current_workshop = ""` (empty string signals completion)
   - `completed_workshops = ["workshop_1", "workshop_2", "workshop_3", "workshop_4", "workshop_5"]`
   - **Allowed:** All 5 workshops (read-only for review)

**Security Enforcement:**
- Participant views use `@participant_required` decorator
- Views check `is_workshop_accessible()` before displaying forms
- Templates conditionally show locked/unlocked state based on allowed list
- HTMX navigation refreshes access state after each submission

### ✅ Workshop Questions (Verified Correct)

All questions in `workshop_questions_schema.json` match the actual Regional MANA methodology:

**Workshop 1 (4 questions):** Community description, quality of life, socio-economic issues, cultural preservation

**Workshop 2 (6 questions):** Vulnerable areas/sectors, aspirations (short/long term), top 3 urgent issues, priority programs, rights issues

**Workshop 3 (5 questions):** Representation in governance, OBC organizations, improving participation, collaboration mechanisms, transparency & equity

**Workshop 4 (5 questions):** Existing programs inventory, access patterns, effectiveness evaluation, digital access, untapped resources

**Workshop 5 (5 questions):** Critical challenges, underlying factors, specific needs, expected outcomes, prioritization rationale

**Total:** 25 questions across 5 workshops

## Files Corrected

1. ✅ `docs/improvements/regional_mana_workshop_redesign_plan.md`
   - Line 13: Changed "six workshops" → "five workshops"

2. ✅ `docs/guidelines/participant_user_guide.md`
   - Lines 100-125: Expanded workshop dashboard visualization to show all 5 workshops with correct titles

---

## Files Verified (Already Correct)

1. ✅ `src/mana/services/workshop_access.py` - Correct 5-workshop sequence
2. ✅ `src/mana/data/workshop_questions_schema.json` - All 5 workshops with correct questions
3. ✅ `src/mana/participant_views.py` - Uses WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE correctly
4. ✅ `src/mana/facilitator_views.py` - Uses WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE correctly
5. ✅ `src/mana/tests/test_workshop_access.py` - Tests 5 workshops correctly
6. ✅ `src/mana/tests/test_workshop_synthesis.py` - Tests workshop_1 correctly
7. ✅ `src/templates/mana/participant/` - Templates use correct access control
8. ✅ `src/templates/mana/facilitator/` - Templates iterate workshops correctly

---

## Sequential Access Control - Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Cannot Skip Workshops ✅
```python
participant.current_workshop = "workshop_1"
participant.completed_workshops = []

manager.is_workshop_accessible(participant, "workshop_3")
# Returns: False (must complete workshop_1 and workshop_2 first)
```

### Scenario 2: Completed Workshops Remain Accessible ✅
```python
participant.current_workshop = "workshop_3"
participant.completed_workshops = ["workshop_1", "workshop_2"]

manager.get_allowed_workshops(participant)
# Returns: ["workshop_1", "workshop_2", "workshop_3"]
# Can review workshop_1 and workshop_2, work on workshop_3
```

### Scenario 3: Auto-Advancement on Completion ✅
```python
manager.mark_workshop_complete(participant, "workshop_2")

participant.refresh_from_db()
# participant.current_workshop == "workshop_3" (auto-advanced)
# participant.completed_workshops == ["workshop_1", "workshop_2"]
```

### Scenario 4: Facilitator Manual Unlock ✅
```python
# Facilitator can override and unlock any workshop
manager.unlock_workshop(participant, "workshop_4", facilitator_user)

participant.refresh_from_db()
# participant.current_workshop == "workshop_4"
# Access log created with action_type="unlock"
```

### Scenario 5: All Workshops Completed ✅
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    manager.mark_workshop_complete(participant, f"workshop_{i}")

participant.refresh_from_db()
# participant.current_workshop == "" (empty = all done)
# participant.completed_workshops == ["workshop_1", ..., "workshop_5"]
# len(completed_workshops) == 5
```

## Confirmation: Implementation is Correct

The actual **implementation is 100% correct** with 5 workshops. The only errors were in:
1. The plan document (documentation typo)
2. The user guide (incomplete visualization)

**All code, schema, tests, and templates correctly implement 5 workshops with proper sequential access control.**

## Live System Verification

To verify on running system:
```bash
# Check workshop sequence
cd src
./manage.py shell
>>> from mana.services.workshop_access import WorkshopAccessManager
>>> WorkshopAccessManager.WORKSHOP_SEQUENCE
['workshop_1', 'workshop_2', 'workshop_3', 'workshop_4', 'workshop_5']

# Check schema
>>> from mana.schema import load_workshop_schema
>>> schema = load_workshop_schema()
>>> list(schema.keys())
['workshop_1', 'workshop_2', 'workshop_3', 'workshop_4', 'workshop_5']

# Test access control
>>> from mana.models import Assessment, WorkshopParticipantAccount
>>> participant = WorkshopParticipantAccount.objects.first()
>>> manager = WorkshopAccessManager(participant.assessment)
>>> manager.get_allowed_workshops(participant)
# Should return based on participant's current progress
```
