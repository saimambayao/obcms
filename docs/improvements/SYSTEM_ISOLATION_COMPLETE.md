# System Isolation - Participants vs Staff Access

**Date:** September 30, 2025
**Issue:** Participants could access legacy MANA system at `/mana/regional/`
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## Problem Identified

Workshop participants (external stakeholders) were able to access the **legacy MANA system** at `/mana/regional/` which is intended **ONLY for OOBC staff and authorized users**.

This was caused by:
1. `ManaParticipantAccessMiddleware.ALLOWED_PREFIXES` incorrectly included `/mana/regional/` and `/mana/provincial/`
2. No staff check in the `mana_regional_overview` view itself

---

## Solution Applied

### 1. Middleware Fix ✅
**File:** `src/mana/middleware.py`
**Lines:** 70-79

**Before:**
```python
ALLOWED_PREFIXES = (
    "/mana/workshops/",
    "/mana/regional/",      # ❌ WRONG - Allows participants
    "/mana/provincial/",    # ❌ WRONG - Allows participants
    "/communities/manageprovincial",
    "/communities/province/",
    "/static/",
)
```

**After:**
```python
ALLOWED_PREFIXES = (
    "/mana/workshops/",  # ✅ New participant workshop system (sequential access)
    "/communities/manageprovincial",
    "/communities/province/",
    "/static/",
)

# Staff-only paths that participants should NOT access
# /mana/regional/ - Legacy MANA system (OOBC staff only)
# /mana/provincial/ - Provincial MANA (OOBC staff only)
```

### 2. View-Level Protection ✅
**File:** `src/common/views/mana.py`
**Lines:** 773-789

**Added:**
```python
@login_required
def mana_regional_overview(request):
    """
    Regional-level overview aligning with the MANA implementation guide.

    STAFF ONLY: This is the legacy MANA system for OOBC staff and authorized users.
    Workshop participants should use /mana/workshops/ (new sequential system).
    """
    # Enforce staff-only access
    if not request.user.is_staff and not request.user.has_perm("mana.can_facilitate_workshop"):
        from django.contrib import messages
        from django.shortcuts import redirect
        messages.error(
            request,
            "Access denied. This area is restricted to OOBC staff. "
            "Participants should access workshops through their participant dashboard."
        )
        return redirect("common:dashboard")

    # ... rest of view logic
```

## Two-System Architecture

OBCMS now properly enforces **two separate MANA systems**:

### System 1: Legacy MANA (Staff Only)
- **URL:** `/mana/regional/`, `/mana/provincial/`
- **Users:** OOBC staff (`is_staff=True`) OR facilitators (`can_facilitate_workshop` permission)
- **Purpose:** Internal staff workflows, province/region coordination, assessment management
- **Access:** ✅ Staff, ❌ Participants

### System 2: Sequential Workshop System (Participants)
- **URL:** `/mana/workshops/assessments/{id}/participant/`
- **Users:** Workshop participants with `WorkshopParticipantAccount`
- **Purpose:** External stakeholder engagement, 5 sequential workshops, structured data collection
- **Access:** ✅ Participants (own assessment only), ✅ Staff (as facilitators)

---

## Access Control Matrix

| User Type | Legacy MANA<br>`/mana/regional/` | Sequential Workshops<br>`/mana/workshops/` | Permissions Required |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| **OOBC Staff** | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Facilitator Dashboard | `is_staff=True` |
| **Facilitator** | ✅ Full Access | ✅ Facilitator Dashboard | `can_facilitate_workshop` |
| **Workshop Participant** | ❌ **DENIED** | ✅ Participant Dashboard (own assessment) | `can_access_regional_mana` + `WorkshopParticipantAccount` |
| **Regular User** | ❌ DENIED | ❌ DENIED | None |

---

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Participant Tries to Access `/mana/regional/`
**Before Fix:**
- Participant logs in
- Navigates to `/mana/regional/`
- **Result:** ❌ Sees legacy MANA interface (WRONG!)

**After Fix:**
- Participant logs in
- Navigates to `/mana/regional/`
- **Result:** ✅ Redirected to `/dashboard/` with error message: "Access denied. This area is restricted to OOBC staff..."

### Test Scenario 2: Staff Accesses Both Systems
**Expected:**
- Staff logs in
- Can access `/mana/regional/` → ✅ Works
- Can access `/mana/workshops/assessments/{id}/facilitator/dashboard/` → ✅ Works
- **Result:** ✅ Both systems accessible

### Test Scenario 3: Participant Sequential Workshop Access
**Expected:**
- Participant logs in
- Completes onboarding
- Sees participant dashboard at `/mana/workshops/assessments/{id}/participant/dashboard/`
- Only workshop_1 is unlocked
- Workshops 2-5 are locked
- Cannot access `/mana/regional/` or `/mana/provincial/`
- **Result:** ✅ Proper isolation maintained

---

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `src/mana/middleware.py` - Removed legacy MANA paths from participant allowed list
2. ✅ `src/common/views/mana.py` - Added staff check to `mana_regional_overview`
3. ✅ `docs/product/mana_two_systems_architecture.md` - Comprehensive documentation created
4. ✅ `docs/improvements/SYSTEM_ISOLATION_COMPLETE.md` - This summary document

---

## Documentation Created

**New File:** `docs/product/mana_two_systems_architecture.md`

Comprehensive 400+ line document covering:
- Overview of both systems
- URL patterns for each system
- User access matrix
- Middleware enforcement details
- Participant workflow (sequential progression)
- Facilitator workflow (management + synthesis)
- Testing scenarios
- Migration strategy
- Key takeaways

---

## Verification Checklist

- [x] Participants CANNOT access `/mana/regional/`
- [x] Participants CANNOT access `/mana/provincial/`
- [x] Participants CAN access `/mana/workshops/assessments/{id}/participant/`
- [x] Participants restricted to their own assessment only
- [x] Staff CAN access both systems
- [x] Facilitators CAN access both systems
- [x] Sequential workshop progression enforced
- [x] Middleware properly filters paths
- [x] View-level staff check in place
- [x] Error messages informative
- [x] Documentation complete

## Impact Assessment

### Who is Affected?
- **Workshop Participants:** Now properly restricted to sequential workshop system only (as intended)
- **OOBC Staff:** No impact, still have full access to both systems
- **Facilitators:** No impact, still have full access to both systems

### Breaking Changes?
**NO** - This is a **security fix**, not a feature change. The intended behavior was always to restrict participants to the workshop system. This fix enforces the original design.

### Migration Required?
**NO** - Changes are backward compatible. Existing participants will automatically be restricted upon next login.

---

## Success Criteria Met

✅ **Isolation:** Participants cannot access legacy MANA system
✅ **Security:** Staff-only areas properly protected
✅ **Usability:** Participants see helpful error message, not confusing interface
✅ **Documentation:** Complete architecture documentation created
✅ **Testing:** Access control scenarios verified

---

## Conclusion

The system isolation issue has been **completely resolved**. Workshop participants are now properly restricted to the **sequential workshop system** at `/mana/workshops/` and cannot access the **legacy MANA system** at `/mana/regional/`.

Two layers of protection ensure this:
1. **Middleware:** `ManaParticipantAccessMiddleware` filters allowed paths
2. **View-level:** `mana_regional_overview` checks staff permissions

Documentation has been created to explain the two-system architecture and prevent future confusion.
