# Organization Middleware Security Considerations

**Document Type:** Security Architecture
**Phase:** BMMS Phase 1 - Foundation
**Classification:** CRITICAL SECURITY
**Created:** 2025-10-13

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the security architecture, threat model, and mitigation strategies for the OrganizationMiddleware implementation in BMMS. The middleware enforces strict multi-tenant data isolation for 44 Ministries, Offices, and Agencies.

**Security Level:** CRITICAL - Prevents unauthorized cross-organization data access

---

## Security Model

### Core Principles

1. **Defense in Depth** - Multiple layers of access control
2. **Least Privilege** - Users limited to minimum necessary access
3. **Audit Everything** - All access attempts logged
4. **Fail Secure** - Deny access on error
5. **Explicit Grants** - No implicit permissions

### Data Isolation Guarantee

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:** MOA A must NEVER access MOA B's data.

**Enforcement Layers:**

1. **Middleware Layer** - URL-based organization extraction and validation
2. **Access Control Layer** - Role-based permission verification
3. **QuerySet Layer** - Thread-local filtering at database level
4. **View Layer** - Additional permission decorators
5. **Template Layer** - Organization-scoped context

## Access Control Matrix

### User Roles and Permissions

| Role | View Own Org | View All Orgs | Modify Own Org | Modify All Orgs | Switch Orgs | Read-Only |
|------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Superuser** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **OCM User** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **OOBC Staff** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| **MOA Staff** | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Guest** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Role Definitions

#### Superuser
- **Access:** Unrestricted access to all organizations
- **Use Case:** System administrators, emergency access
- **Risk Level:** HIGHEST
- **Audit:** All actions logged with high priority

#### OCM User (Office of Chief Minister)
- **Access:** Read-only access to all organizations
- **Use Case:** Strategic oversight, aggregation reporting, policy monitoring
- **Risk Level:** HIGH (read access to all data)
- **Audit:** All access logged for compliance
- **Restrictions:**
  - CANNOT modify any data
  - CANNOT create/delete organizations
  - CANNOT manage users

#### OOBC Staff (Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities)

## Threat Model

### Threat T1: Unauthorized Cross-Organization Access

**Description:** MOA staff attempts to access another organization's data

**Attack Vectors:**
1. URL manipulation: `/moa/other-org/data/`
2. Query parameter injection: `?org=other-org`
3. Session hijacking: Steal OCM or OOBC staff session
4. API endpoint exploitation: Direct API calls bypassing middleware

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Middleware validates organization access before setting `request.organization`
- ✅ Returns 403 Forbidden if access denied
- ✅ Logs all access attempts with user, organization, and path
- ✅ Thread-local storage ensures QuerySet-level filtering
- ✅ View decorators enforce additional checks

**Risk Level:** HIGH → LOW (after mitigation)

---

### Threat T2: Session Hijacking

**Description:** Attacker steals session cookie to gain organization access

**Attack Vectors:**
1. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
2. Network sniffing (if HTTPS not enforced)
3. Session fixation
4. CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ HTTPS enforced in production (HSTS headers)
- ✅ Secure cookies (httponly, secure flags)
- ✅ CSRF protection enabled
- ✅ Session timeout after inactivity
- ✅ Django Axes: Failed login tracking
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement session binding to IP address

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

---

### Threat T3: Privilege Escalation

**Description:** MOA staff attempts to escalate to OCM or OOBC privileges

**Attack Vectors:**
1. User profile manipulation
2. Role field tampering
3. Database direct access
4. API endpoint exploitation

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Role fields protected by Django admin permissions
- ✅ User creation requires approval
- ✅ Role changes logged in audit trail
- ✅ Database access restricted to authenticated staff
- ⚠️ TODO: Implement role change workflow with approval

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM

---

### Threat T4: Data Leakage via Template Context

**Description:** Organization data exposed in templates for unauthorized users

**Attack Vectors:**
1. Template injection
2. Context variable leakage
3. Cached template rendering
4. Server-side template injection (SSTI)

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Organization context only set for authenticated users
- ✅ Django template auto-escaping enabled
- ✅ Templates filter data by `request.organization`
- ✅ No user-controlled template rendering
- ⚠️ TODO: Review all templates for organization filtering

**Risk Level:** LOW

---

### Threat T5: Thread-Local Storage Leakage

**Description:** Organization context persists across requests in thread-local

**Attack Vectors:**
1. Thread reuse in WSGI/ASGI servers
2. Exception preventing cleanup
3. Concurrent request handling

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ `clear_current_organization()` called in middleware `__call__`
- ✅ Try-finally blocks ensure cleanup
- ✅ Thread-local specific to each request thread
- ✅ No shared state between requests
- ⚠️ TODO: Add monitoring for thread-local leaks

**Risk Level:** MEDIUM → LOW

---

### Threat T6: API Bypass

**Description:** API requests bypass middleware organization checks

**Attack Vectors:**
1. Direct API calls without organization context
2. DRF ViewSets without permission classes
3. GraphQL queries bypassing REST framework
4. Webhook endpoints without authentication

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Middleware applies to ALL requests (including API)
- ✅ DRF permission classes check organization access
- ✅ API authentication required by default
- ⚠️ TODO: Ensure all ViewSets use organization filtering
- ⚠️ TODO: Add API-specific organization validation

**Risk Level:** HIGH → MEDIUM

---

### Threat T7: URL Pattern Collision

**Description:** URL patterns conflict with organization codes

**Attack Vectors:**
1. Organization code matches static URL: `/moa/static/`
2. Organization code matches admin URL: `/moa/admin/`
3. Special characters in organization codes

**Mitigations:**
- ✅ Regex pattern validates organization code format: `[\w-]+`
- ✅ Organization acronym validation in model
- ✅ Static/media URLs at root level, not under `/moa/`
- ⚠️ TODO: Reserve special organization codes
- ⚠️ TODO: Document URL pattern guidelines

**Risk Level:** LOW

---

## Security Best Practices

### Development Guidelines

#### DO ✅

1. **Always use `request.organization`** - Never assume organization from URL
2. **Filter QuerySets by organization** - Use `filter(moa_organization=request.organization)`
3. **Check `request.organization` exists** - Handle None case gracefully
4. **Use view decorators** - `@requires_organization` for critical views
5. **Log security events** - Log all access denied events
6. **Test with different roles** - Verify each role's access level
7. **Validate organization in forms** - Don't trust client-submitted org

#### DON'T ❌

1. **Never trust URL organization** - Always validate via middleware
2. **Never skip middleware** - Don't create organization-less views
3. **Never hardcode organization IDs** - Use dynamic lookups
4. **Never expose all organizations** - Filter by user access
5. **Never allow organization switching for MOA staff** - Enforce restrictions
6. **Never cache organization context** - Use per-request context
7. **Never bypass permission checks** - Trust the middleware

### Code Review Checklist

When reviewing code that touches organization data:

- [ ] Does view check `request.organization` exists?
- [ ] Are QuerySets filtered by organization?
- [ ] Are forms validated for organization access?
- [ ] Are permission decorators used?
- [ ] Are error messages user-friendly?
- [ ] Are security events logged?
- [ ] Is MOA staff restricted from other organizations?
- [ ] Can OCM users modify data? (Should be read-only)
- [ ] Are API endpoints organization-scoped?
- [ ] Are templates using organization context?

## Audit Logging

### What We Log

1. **Successful Access**
   ```
   INFO: Organization set: user123 accessing Ministry of Health. Path: /moa/moh/dashboard/
   ```

2. **Access Denied**
   ```
   WARNING: Access denied: moa_user attempted to access Ministry of Education
   without permission. Path: /moa/moe/data/
   ```

3. **Organization Not Found**
   ```
   ERROR: Organization 'invalid-org' not found. User: user123, Path: /moa/invalid-org/
   ```

4. **Fallback Organization**
   ```
   DEBUG: Using fallback organization for user123: Ministry of Health
   ```

### Log Retention

- **Security Logs:** 1 year minimum
- **Access Logs:** 90 days minimum
- **Audit Logs:** 5 years (compliance requirement)

### Log Monitoring

**Critical Alerts:**
- Multiple access denied attempts from same user (potential attack)
- Access attempts to non-existent organizations (reconnaissance)
- Organization switching by MOA staff (policy violation)
- Unusual access patterns (e.g., accessing 20+ organizations rapidly)

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```python
def test_moa_staff_cannot_access_other_org(self):
    """MOA staff should not access other organizations."""
    moa_user = create_moa_staff(org=org_a)
    request = self.factory.get(f'/moa/{org_b.acronym}/dashboard/')
    request.user = moa_user

    org = middleware._get_organization_from_request(request)
    self.assertIsNone(org)  # Access denied
```

### Integration Tests

```python
def test_cross_org_data_isolation(self):
    """Verify MOA A cannot see MOA B's data."""
    moa_a_user = create_moa_staff(org=org_a)
    self.client.force_login(moa_a_user)

    # Create data for both organizations
    create_ppa(org=org_a, name="PPA A")
    create_ppa(org=org_b, name="PPA B")

    # Access MOA A data - should see only own data
    response = self.client.get(f'/moa/{org_a.acronym}/ppas/')
    self.assertContains(response, "PPA A")
    self.assertNotContains(response, "PPA B")

    # Attempt to access MOA B data - should be denied
    response = self.client.get(f'/moa/{org_b.acronym}/ppas/')
    self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 403)
```

### Security Tests

```python
def test_url_manipulation_attack(self):
    """Test URL manipulation to access other organizations."""
    moa_user = create_moa_staff(org=org_a)
    self.client.force_login(moa_user)

    # Attempt various URL manipulations
    attack_urls = [
        f'/moa/{org_b.acronym}/data/',
        f'/moa/../{org_b.acronym}/data/',
        f'/moa/{org_b.id}/data/',
        f'/../moa/{org_b.acronym}/data/',
    ]

    for url in attack_urls:
        response = self.client.get(url)
        self.assertIn(response.status_code, [403, 404])
```
