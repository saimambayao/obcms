Priority: MEDIUM
Complexity: Simple
Estimated Complexity: Low

Description:
  Transition from rollout mode to steady-state operations, hand off to
  support team, and close out rollout project.

Subtasks:

    Meeting (2 hours) after Wave 9:
    - Review success metrics (actual vs target)
    - Celebrate successes
    - Discuss challenges and lessons learned
    - Review support ticket trends
    - Assess readiness for steady-state
    - Approve transition to operations

[ ] 10.2 Create Rollout Completion Report
    File: docs/reports/ROLLOUT_COMPLETION_REPORT.md
    Sections:
    - Executive summary
    - Rollout statistics (44 MOAs, 700+ users)
    - Success metrics achieved
    - Timeline (planned vs actual)
    - Budget (planned vs actual)
    - Challenges and solutions
    - Lessons learned
    - User satisfaction summary
    - Recommendations for future rollouts
    - Appendices: Data tables, charts

[ ] 10.3 Handoff to Operations Team
    Deliverables:
    - System documentation (up-to-date)
    - Runbooks (incident response, maintenance)
    - Access credentials (secure vault)
    - Monitoring dashboards (logins)
    - Help desk knowledge base (access)
    - Escalation procedures (contacts)
    - Training: 2-day operations training for ops team

[ ] 10.4 Schedule Post-Rollout Support
    Support plan (3 months):
    - Enhanced support (4-6 help desk agents)
    - Extended office hours (8 AM - 6 PM)
    - Weekly check-ins with MOAs
    - Monthly user satisfaction surveys
    - Gradual transition to standard support

    After 3 months:
    - Standard support (2-3 help desk agents)
    - Regular office hours (8 AM - 5 PM)
    - Quarterly check-ins with MOAs
    - Quarterly user surveys

[ ] 10.5 Celebrate and Close Project
    - Organize team celebration (lunch/dinner)
    - Thank MOA participants (certificates)
    - Publish success story (internal newsletter)
    - Archive project documents
    - Close Jira/GitHub project
    - Update resumes (team members)
    - Conduct retrospective (final lessons learned)

Testing Checklist:
[ ] Final rollout review completed
[ ] Rollout completion report published
[ ] Handoff to operations team done
[ ] Post-rollout support scheduled
[ ] Team celebration organized
[ ] Project officially closed

DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
================================================================================

Pre-Rollout:
[ ] Wave plan finalized (9 waves, 5-10 MOAs each)
[ ] Infrastructure scaled (4-6 servers, 500+ connections)

[ ] Training materials updated (based on pilot)
[ ] Help desk operational (ticketing, knowledge base, chat)
[ ] Monitoring dashboards created
[ ] Risk register reviewed

During Rollout (per wave):
[ ] User accounts created (batch import)
[ ] Welcome emails sent (100% delivery)
[ ] Training sessions conducted (>80% attendance)
[ ] Office hours staffed (2 hrs/day)
[ ] Issues tracked and resolved (daily triage)
[ ] Daily reports sent (project team)
[ ] Success metrics tracked (dashboard)
[ ] Risks reviewed (weekly meeting)

Post-Rollout:
[ ] All 44 MOAs onboarded successfully
[ ] All 700+ users trained
[ ] Final rollout review conducted
[ ] Rollout completion report published
[ ] Handoff to operations team complete
[ ] Post-rollout support scheduled
[ ] Project closed

================================================================================

NOTES
================================================================================

Wave Strategy Rationale:
- Gradual rollout reduces risk (vs. big-bang)
- 2 weeks per wave allows stabilization time
- Grouping by ministry type enables shared learning
- Buffer weeks allow catching up on delays

Key Risks:
- System outage (mitigation: high availability, failover)
- Overwhelmed help desk (mitigation: staff adequately, knowledge base)
- Low adoption (mitigation: executive sponsorship, quality training)
- Timeline delays (mitigation: buffer weeks, resource flexibility)

Timeline Estimate:
- Wave planning: 1 week
- Infrastructure prep: 2 weeks
- Rollout execution: 16-18 weeks (9 waves × 2 weeks)
- Post-rollout transition: 2 weeks
- Total: 21-23 weeks (5-6 months)

Resource Requirements:
- Project Manager: 1 FTE
- Technical Lead: 1 FTE
- Developers: 2-3 FTEs (bug fixes, enhancements)
- Trainers: 2 FTEs (rotating)
- Help Desk: 7-9 FTEs (shifts)
- Total: 13-16 FTEs

Budget Considerations:
- Infrastructure: ~$5,000/month (scaled servers, monitoring)
- Help desk software: ~$500/month (Zendesk, Jira)
- Training platform: ~$300/month (Zoom, LMS)
- Monitoring tools: ~$700/month (New Relic, Datadog)
- Total: ~$6,500/month during rollout

Post-Rollout Recommendations:
- Continue monthly user surveys (track satisfaction)
- Quarterly feature releases (based on feedback)
- Annual BMMS conference (best practices, networking)
- Expand to more modules (MANA, M&E) after stabilization
