âœ… Go/no-go decision made (GO)
âœ… Ready for Phase 8 (full rollout)

================================================================================
NOTES
================================================================================

Pilot MOA Selection Rationale:
- MOH: Healthcare is critical, high visibility
- MOLE: Labor programs serve large populations
- MAFAR: Agriculture is BARMM's economic backbone

These 3 MOAs represent diverse use cases and will stress-test the system
comprehensively.

Key Risks:
- Low user adoption (mitigation: quality training)
- Major bugs found (mitigation: thorough UAT)
- Performance issues (mitigation: load testing)
- Resistance to change (mitigation: executive buy-in)

Timeline Estimate:
- Data setup: 1 day
- User account creation: 2 days
- Training materials: 1 week
- Training sessions: 3 days
- UAT: 2 weeks
- Bug fixing: 1-2 weeks
- Sign-off: 3 days
- Total: 5-6 weeks

Dependencies for Next Phase:
- Phase 8: Full Rollout requires successful pilot completion
- All 3 MOAs must sign off before proceeding
- Go decision required from go/no-go meeting
