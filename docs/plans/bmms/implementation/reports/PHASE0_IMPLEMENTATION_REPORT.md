## Issues Discovered

### Critical Issues: 0

None

### High Priority Issues: 1

**Issue #1: Middleware Import Path**
- **Location:** `src/common/middleware/organization_context.py` line 44
- **Problem:** Imports Organization from `coordination.models` instead of `organizations.models`
- **Impact:** Will cause import errors when middleware is used
- **Resolution:** Must be fixed in Phase -1 or Phase 1
- **Severity:** HIGH (blocks proper functionality)

### Medium Priority Issues: 1

**Issue #2: Test Import Error**
- **Location:** `src/budget_preparation/tests`
- **Problem:** Module import structure issue
- **Impact:** Prevents running full test suite
- **Resolution:** Investigate test structure
- **Severity:** MEDIUM (does not block development)

### Low Priority Issues: 1

**Issue #3: Pending Index Migrations**
- **Location:** Multiple apps (coordination, ocm, organizations)
- **Problem:** Model changes detected for index renames
- **Impact:** None (cosmetic migrations)
- **Resolution:** Create migrations in appropriate phase
- **Severity:** LOW (cosmetic only)

## Recommendations

### For Phase 1 (Configuration Infrastructure)

1. **Address Middleware Import Issue FIRST**
   - Change line 44 in `src/common/middleware/organization_context.py`
   - FROM: `from coordination.models import Organization`
   - TO: `from organizations.models import Organization`

2. **Create BMMS Configuration Module**
   - Implement `src/obc_management/settings/bmms_config.py`
   - Add BMMS_MODE configuration
   - Add mode detection utilities

3. **Update Environment Files**
   - Create `.env.obcms`
   - Create `.env.bmms`
   - Add BMMS_MODE and DEFAULT_ORGANIZATION_CODE

### For Phase -1 (If Needed)

Review the Phase -1 Reconciliation Plan to determine if pre-implementation reconciliation is required before proceeding with Phase 1.

### For Test Suite Issues

Create separate issue to investigate and resolve:
- `budget_preparation/tests` import structure
- Ensure test discovery works correctly
- Document any test framework changes needed

## Rollback Procedure

If Phase 0 needs to be rolled back:

### 1. Restore Database (if needed)
```bash
cd src/
cp db.sqlite3.backup-20251014-161027 db.sqlite3
```

### 2. Delete Feature Branch (if needed)
```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D feature/bmms-embedded-architecture
git push origin --delete feature/bmms-embedded-architecture
```

### 3. Clean Up Documentation Files
```bash
rm BASELINE_METRICS.txt src/BACKUP_INFO.txt
rm docs/plans/bmms/implementation/reports/PHASE0_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md
```

### 4. Restore to Baseline Commit
```bash
git checkout 7438051493bf0b0aaefdfe606b478d442dd470f4
```

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Review HIGH priority issue #1** (Middleware import path)
2. **Decide on Phase -1 Reconciliation** (review reconciliation plan)
3. **Proceed to Phase 1** (if reconciliation not needed)

### Phase 1 Prerequisites

Before starting Phase 1:
- [ ] Decision made on Phase -1 reconciliation need
- [ ] Middleware import issue resolution plan documented
- [ ] Team review of baseline metrics (if applicable)

### Phase 1 Preparation

Files to be created in Phase 1:
1. `src/obc_management/settings/bmms_config.py`
2. `src/organizations/utils/__init__.py`
3. `.env.obcms`
4. `.env.bmms`

Modifications in Phase 1:
1. `src/obc_management/settings/base.py` (add BMMS configuration)
2. `src/common/middleware/organization_context.py` (fix import)
