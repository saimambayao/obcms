**Status:** Organizations and Budget Execution apps activated ✅
**Task Files Created:** 4 comprehensive detailed task files ✅

---

## ✅ ACTIVATION COMPLETED

### 1. Organizations App - ACTIVATED

**File Modified:** `src/obc_management/settings/base.py`

**Change:**
```python
LOCAL_APPS = [
    "common",
    "organizations",  # ← ADDED - Phase 1: BMMS multi-tenant foundation (44 MOAs)
    "communities",
    # ... rest
]
```

**Migrations Applied:**
```
✅ organizations.0001_initial
✅ organizations.0002_seed_barmm_organizations
```

**Verification Results:**
```
Total Organizations: 45 (44 MOAs + OOBC)
OOBC: Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (ID=1)
Pilot MOAs: 3 (MAFAR, MOH, MOLE)

Breakdown:
- Ministries: 16
- Offices: 11 (including OOBC)
- Agencies: 8
- Special Bodies: 7
- Commissions: 3
```

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

---

### 2. Budget Execution App - ALREADY ACTIVE

**Discovery:** The Budget Execution app was already installed and operational.

**Verified:**
```python
from budget_execution.models import Allotment, Obligation, Disbursement, DisbursementLineItem
# All models accessible ✅
```

**Models Available:**
- `Allotment` - Budget allotment tracking
- `Obligation` - Budget obligation management
- `Disbursement` - Disbursement tracking
- `DisbursementLineItem` - Line-item tracking

**Budget Preparation:** Also already installed and operational

**Status:** ✅ **FULLY OPERATIONAL**

## 📋 COMPREHENSIVE TASK FILES CREATED

The architect agent created **4 detailed task files** for remaining BMMS implementation:

- ✅ Uses JSONField for MOA codes (backward compatible)
- ✅ Permission system (lead vs. participant organizations)
- ✅ Invitation workflow
- ✅ Partnership templates with OBCMS UI standards
- ✅ Complete test suite

**Critical Design Decision:**
- Does NOT add organization FKs to existing models
- Creates parallel model for inter-MOA features
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility with OOBC data

---

### 2. Phase 6: OCM Aggregation
**File:** `docs/plans/bmms/tasks/phase6_ocm_aggregation_detailed.txt`

- Zero impact on existing data
- Backward compatible
- Admin-only initially

### 2. **No Organization FKs Yet** ✅
- Allows gradual, controlled migration
- Reduces risk
- Permits testing before full commit
- Easy rollback if needed

### 3. **Task Files First, Implementation Second** ✅
- Comprehensive planning before coding
- Clear task breakdown for execution
- Parallel work opportunities identified
- Time estimates for project planning

### 4. **Infrastructure-Heavy Approach** ✅
