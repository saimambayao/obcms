# OBCMS Performance Testing Overview

## Objectives
- Define the full spectrum of performance test categories needed to protect OBCMS service-level targets.
- Map each category to platform modules, environments, and supporting tools.
- Provide actionable guidelines that avoid timeline estimates while clarifying priority, complexity, dependencies, and prerequisites.

## Test Categories

### Load Testing
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Dependencies:** Core API endpoints, HTMX interaction surfaces, baseline infrastructure sizing.
- **Prerequisites:** Stable staging environment, k6 baseline scripts, seeded database with representative data volume.
- **Purpose:** Validate that average and peak daily usage can be handled without breaching latency SLAs or exceeding CPU/memory budgets.
- **Implementation Notes:** Execute with k6 (`constant-vus`, `ramping-vus`) and complement with Locust for live user behavior modeling when needed. Prioritize high-traffic modules including communities directories, coordination kanban, monitoring dashboards, recommendations management, and executive analytics APIs.

### Stress Testing
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Dependencies:** Autoscaling policies, rate-limiting middleware, cache configuration.
- **Prerequisites:** Observability stack in place (Grafana, Prometheus/InfluxDB), alert thresholds defined.
- **Purpose:** Identify the breaking point of services and confirm graceful degradation under extreme but short-lived surges.
- **Implementation Notes:** Extend k6 scripts with `ramping-arrival-rate` to push beyond expected concurrency; capture recovery time and error growth.

### Spike Testing
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Dependencies:** Queue consumers, HTMX partial endpoints, authentication layer.
- **Prerequisites:** Ability to replay real spike scenarios (e.g., mass policy updates, advisory broadcasts).
- **Purpose:** Ensure OBCMS can absorb sudden bursts triggered by emergency coordination or broadcast events without cascading failures.
- **Implementation Notes:** Use k6 scenarios with abrupt VU jumps; pair with synthetic Celery task injection to mirror downstream load—particularly for WorkItem escalations, recommendations approvals, and rapid dashboard refreshes.

### Soak / Endurance Testing
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Complexity:** Complex
- **Dependencies:** Background jobs, scheduled tasks, database connection pooling, cache eviction rules.
- **Prerequisites:** Long-running staging environment with monitoring for resource drift, log rotation policies.
- **Purpose:** Detect memory leaks, slow resource exhaustion, or data integrity drift during prolonged activity windows.
- **Implementation Notes:** Run k6 for extended durations (hours) with `constant-arrival-rate`; monitor DB connections, Celery worker heartbeat, cache hit ratios.

### Volume / Data Growth Testing
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** Complex
- **Dependencies:** Data imports (`data_imports`), reporting queries, storage tier.
- **Prerequisites:** High-volume fixture generation scripts, isolated database snapshot.
- **Purpose:** Validate performance of data-heavy operations (bulk imports, complex reports) as records approach projected maxima.
- **Implementation Notes:** Combine batch scripts with targeted k6 or CLI tools; analyze query plans and storage growth across monitoring WorkItems, recommendations archives, planning scenarios, and M&E indicators.

### Scalability Testing
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** Complex
- **Dependencies:** Horizontal scaling topology (app servers, Celery workers), database replicas, load balancer configuration.
- **Prerequisites:** Infrastructure-as-code or deployment scripts capable of adding/removing nodes on demand.
- **Purpose:** Measure performance changes when scaling resources up or down, ensuring linear or near-linear throughput gains.
- **Implementation Notes:** Coordinate with infrastructure team; use k6 distributed execution or cloud-based runners to maintain sustained load while varying resources.

### Capacity Testing
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** Moderate
- **Dependencies:** Aggregate resource budgets (CPU, memory, IOPS), service limits from cloud providers.
- **Prerequisites:** Resource dashboards with utilization metrics, cost and quota documentation.
- **Purpose:** Determine maximum concurrent users and operations supported by the current footprint before SLA breaches occur.
- **Implementation Notes:** Start from load-test baselines; increment concurrency until thresholds fail; record resource headroom for planning, especially for calendar-heavy monitoring operations and analytics dashboards.

### Resilience / Chaos Testing
- **Priority:** MEDIUM
- **Complexity:** Complex
- **Dependencies:** Fallback mechanisms, retry logic, failover databases, message queues.
- **Prerequisites:** Chaos tooling (e.g., Chaos Mesh, Gremlin) or scripted failure injection, incident response runbooks.
- **Purpose:** Validate service stability when dependencies fail (DB outage, cache flush, network latency spikes) and confirm user-facing impact stays acceptable.
- **Implementation Notes:** Pair failure injection with active load tests; monitor HTMX error banners, API error rates, and recovery workflows.

## Tooling & Automation
- Primary load tool: k6 (see [k6 Load Testing Plan](obcms_k6_load_testing_plan.md)).
- Supplemental tools:
  - Locust for user-behavior scripting.
  - Apache JMeter for complex multipart or SOAP legacy integrations.
  - Chaos tooling (Chaos Mesh, Gremlin) for resilience experiments.
- Results aggregation: Grafana dashboards fed by Prometheus/InfluxDB exporters, CI artifacts stored under `reports/performance/`.

## Process Integration
- Schedule high-priority categories (load, stress, soak) on recurring cadences aligned with release trains.
- Trigger medium-priority categories before major infrastructure or module rollouts.
- Capture findings in `reports/performance/` with remediation tasks filed in the issue tracker.
- Update test plans when new modules launch or infrastructure changes modify dependencies.

## Next Steps
- **Priority:** HIGH — Finalize tooling stack and automate load/stress scenarios in CI.
- **Priority:** HIGH — Define soak-test cadence and monitoring alerts for resource drift.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM — Stand up chaos testing workflow tied to staging or canary environments.
- **Priority:** MEDIUM — Document data volume fixture generation scripts for volume and scalability exercises.
