## DATABASE MIGRATION STRATEGY

### Migration Phases

**Phase 1: Additive Migrations Only**
- Create new models
- Add new fields to existing models
- Create indexes
- No destructive changes

**Migration Files:**
```
automation/migrations/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0001_initial.py (QuarterlyMeetingSeries, MeetingReminder)
service_catalog/migrations/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0001_initial.py (ServiceCatalogEntry, ServiceRequest)
ocm_dashboard/migrations/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0001_initial.py (OCMDashboardSnapshot, BeneficiaryOverlap)
reporting/migrations/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0001_initial.py (ReportTemplate, ReportSchedule)
community_portal/migrations/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0001_initial.py (PortalFeedback, DigitalConsultation)
external_api/migrations/
â”œâ”€â”€ 0001_initial.py (APIClient, APIAccessLog)
```

**Migration Testing:**
```bash
# Test migrations on dev database
python manage.py makemigrations --dry-run
python manage.py migrate --plan
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial  # For testing rollback

# Test on staging with production data snapshot
pg_dump production_db | psql staging_db
python manage.py migrate --database staging
```

**Rollback Plan:**
```bash
# Each migration is reversible
python manage.py migrate automation zero  # Rollback all automation migrations
python manage.py migrate service_catalog 0001  # Rollback to migration 0001
```
