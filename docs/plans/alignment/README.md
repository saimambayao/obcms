## KEY TECHNICAL DECISIONS

### New Django Apps (6)

```
automation/          - Meeting automation
service_catalog/     - Public service catalog
ocm_dashboard/       - OCM oversight dashboard
reporting/           - Automated report generation
community_portal/    - Community participation
external_api/        - Inter-agency data sharing
```

### Service Layer Pattern

All business logic in service classes:
```python
from automation.services import MeetingSchedulerService

service = MeetingSchedulerService(fiscal_year=2025)
meetings = service.generate_quarterly_meetings()
```

### API Versioning

```
/api/v1/internal/...    - Internal (JWT)
/api/v1/public/...      - Public (CORS)
/api/v1/external/...    - External (OAuth2)
```

### Background Tasks

**Celery Beat Schedule:**
- Generate quarterly meetings (quarterly)
- Send meeting reminders (hourly)
- Generate dashboard snapshot (daily)
- Generate scheduled reports (daily)
- Detect beneficiary overlaps (weekly)
- Analyze service gaps (weekly)

### Caching Strategy

**Redis caching with TTLs:**
- Service catalog list: 1 hour
- Dashboard snapshot: 24 hours
- Meeting list: 1 hour
- Report output: 7 days
