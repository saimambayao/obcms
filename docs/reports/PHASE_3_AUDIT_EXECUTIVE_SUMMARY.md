# Phase 3 Audit - Executive Summary

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

---

## Quick Facts

| Category | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| **Phase 3 Progress** | ❌ 0% | Zero implementation |
| **Models** | ❌ 0/3 | WorkPackage, EVMBaseline, EVMSnapshot missing |
| **Services** | ❌ 0/2 | EVM Service, Critical Path Service missing |
| **Views** | ❌ 0/3 | EVM Dashboard, Gantt Chart, Network Diagram missing |
| **Overall Roadmap** | ⚠️ 25% | Only Phase 1-2 complete |

---

## What Was Expected (Phase 3)

### Earned Value Management
- ❌ WorkPackage model with BAC, PV, EV, AC fields
- ❌ EVM calculations: SPI, CPI, EAC, ETC, VAC, TCPI
- ❌ EVM dashboard with health indicators
- ❌ Portfolio-level EVM rollup

### Advanced Scheduling
- ❌ Critical path analysis (ES, EF, LS, LF, Float)
- ❌ Gantt chart view with drag-and-drop
- ❌ Network diagram (Activity-on-Node)
- ❌ Baseline vs actual comparison

---

## What Actually Exists

### ✅ Completed (Phase 1-2)
- Database foundation (WorkItem integration)
- Service layer (budget distribution, workitem generation)
- Signal-based automation
- Audit logging

### ❌ Missing (Phase 3)
- All EVM features
- All critical path features
- All visual scheduling tools

---

## Business Impact

### Current Limitations
1. **No Performance Measurement** - Cannot calculate SPI/CPI
2. **No Forecasting** - Cannot predict final costs (EAC)
3. **No Critical Path** - Cannot identify schedule-critical tasks
4. **No Visual Tools** - No Gantt charts or network diagrams
5. **COA Compliance Gap** - EVM expected for projects >₱5M

### Alignment Score
- **Current:** 65/100 (tactical task management)
- **Target:** 93/100 (enterprise PPM with EVM)
- **Gap:** 28 points due to missing Phase 3

---

## Recommendations

### Option 1: Full Implementation ✅ RECOMMENDED
**Effort:** 18-28 days (3.6-5.6 weeks)
**Cost:** 1 Senior Django dev + 1 Frontend dev + PM consultant
**Result:** Complete roadmap, 93/100 alignment, COA compliant

### Option 2: Partial Implementation (Compromise)
**Effort:** 8-13 days (1.6-2.6 weeks)
**Scope:** EVM core + Critical path only (no visuals)
**Result:** 75/100 alignment, basic compliance

### Option 3: Defer (Not Recommended)
**Effort:** 0 days
**Consequence:** Alignment stays at 65/100, potential audit findings

## Implementation Priorities

If proceeding with Option 1:

**Week 1-2: EVM Core**
1. WorkPackage model (2 days)
2. EVM calculation service (3 days)
3. Basic dashboard (2 days)

**Week 3-4: Critical Path**
4. Critical path service (3 days)
5. Integration with WorkItem (2 days)

**Week 5-6: Visuals**
6. Gantt chart view (4 days)
7. Network diagram (3 days)
8. Testing & documentation (2 days)

## Decision Required

**Question:** Proceed with Phase 3 implementation?

- [ ] **Yes - Full Implementation** (Option 1)
- [ ] **Yes - Partial Implementation** (Option 2)
- [ ] **Defer to next fiscal year** (Option 3)

**Next Steps if Yes:**
1. Allocate development resources
2. Assign project team
3. Set target completion date
4. Begin with EVM Core (highest ROI)
