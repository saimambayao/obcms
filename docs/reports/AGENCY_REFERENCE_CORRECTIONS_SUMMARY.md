## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions:
1. ✅ **Review companion documents** for similar inaccuracies (search for "MBM" in other .md files)
2. ✅ **Update code comments** if any source code references "MBM" instead of "MFBM"
3. ✅ **Verify UI labels** in OBCMS templates (budget forms, approval workflows)
4. ✅ **Update user documentation** if any end-user guides reference "MBM"

### Search Commands:
```bash
# Search all markdown files for "MBM" references
grep -rn "MBM" docs/

# Search source code for "MBM" references
grep -rn "MBM" src/ --include="*.py" --include="*.html"
```
