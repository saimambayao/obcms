## ðŸš€ Recommended Actions

### Immediate (This Week - 4 hours)

**Impact:** Fixes 83% of flake8 issues, resolves all critical security warnings

1. **Fix syntax error** in `common/views.py` (2 minutes)
2. **Replace MD5 with SHA-256** in 2 files (5 minutes)
3. **Remove unused imports** using autoflake (15 minutes)
4. **Configure Black formatter** and run on codebase (30 minutes)
5. **Fix bare except clauses** - 5 instances (30 minutes)
6. **Configure pre-commit hooks** (30 minutes)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Code Quality Score: 82 â†’ 87 (B+ â†’ A-)
- Flake8 Issues: 2,149 â†’ ~400 (81% reduction)
- Security Issues (High): 2 â†’ 0

### Short-term (Next 2 Weeks - 3 days)

**Impact:** Improves maintainability and reduces complexity

7. **Refactor high-complexity functions** (2-3 days)
   - `import_moa_ppas.py:Command.handle` (complexity 56 â†’ 15)
   - `RecurringEventPattern.get_occurrences` (complexity 48 â†’ 15)
8. **Begin splitting large files** (start with `common/views/management.py`)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Code Quality Score: 87 â†’ 90 (A- â†’ A)
- All functions < complexity 20

### Medium-term (2 Months - 2-3 weeks)

**Impact:** Achieves excellent maintainability across codebase

9. **Complete file modularization** (4 large files)
10. **Improve class documentation** to 85%
11. **Address WorkItem migration TODOs** (architectural improvement)

**Expected Outcome:**
- Code Quality Score: 90 â†’ 95 (A â†’ A+)
- All files maintainability index > B
- Zero files > 2,000 lines
