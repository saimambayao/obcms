## ABOUT THE TITLE

The title, “ASSISTANCE TO OTHER BANGSAMORO COMMUNITIES: Integrated Report and Policy Recommendations,” is rooted in Section 12, Article VI of Republic Act No. 11054, also known as the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), which mandates the provision of assistance to Bangsamoro people residing outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). This section of the BOL ensures the protection of the rights of Bangsamoro people residing in communities outside the BARMM and directs the undertaking of programs for their rehabilitation and development. It further stipulates that the Bangsamoro Government, in coordination with local government units and appropriate national government agencies, should provide assistance to enhance the economic, social, and cultural development of these communities.

This title was chosen to directly reflect the core mandate of the Bangsamoro Government to address the needs of Bangsamoro communities outside the BARMM. The phrase “Other Bangsamoro Communities” (OBCs) specifically acknowledges the Bangsamoro people living outside the core territory of the BARMM. Despite not being part of the BARMM’s political boundaries, these communities maintain a strong Bangsamoro identity and are entitled to the same rights and development opportunities as those within the region. The use of "Integrated Report" signifies a holistic approach to documenting the current situation of the OBCs, encompassing various aspects of their lives. This report aims to consolidate data from consultations, mapping, and needs assessments to provide a comprehensive overview. Furthermore, the inclusion of “Policy Recommendations” indicates that the document will propose actionable measures and strategies to address the identified needs and challenges of the OBCs. These recommendations are intended to guide decision-makers in improving the socio-economic, cultural, and political conditions of the OBCs.

The BOL recognizes that while the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region has a defined territory, the Bangsamoro people live in communities throughout Mindanao and its adjacent islands. The BOL acknowledges that these communities, while outside the BARMM’s formal jurisdiction, should also benefit from the Bangsamoro government's programs and initiatives. The title therefore serves as a declaration of the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment to its people, irrespective of their geographic location. It reflects the understanding that the Bangsamoro struggle is not limited by geographic boundaries but is a collective endeavor to ensure the well-being and self-determination of all Bangsamoro people.

In essence, the title was chosen to precisely articulate the document's purpose: to integrate findings and needs of the OBCs and formulate policies to promote their welfare and development in accordance with the BOL. It highlights the dual nature of the document as both a comprehensive report and a set of actionable recommendations.

 
## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This document entitled, “Assistance to Other Bangsamoro Communities: Integrated Report and Policy Recommendations” outlines the collective efforts of the Bangsamoro Government and its partners to support Bangsamoro communities residing outside the BARMM. It offers a concise overview of the OBCs’ socio-economic realities based on consultations, mapping and needs assessments (MANA), and coordination meetings conducted from 2022 to 2024. It details accomplishments to date, identifies pressing needs in Regions IX, XI, XII, and Palawan, and proposes ten policy and program recommendations that aim to improve the welfare and development of OBCs in line with Section 12, Article VI of the Bangsamoro Organic Law.  

### Key Findings

1. Socio-Economic Disparities

Consultations and MANA data confirm that OBCs contend with high poverty, limited job prospects, and weak market links. Families often subsist on small-scale agriculture or fisheries in areas hindered by subpar roads, power outages, and meager social support.  

2. Gaps in Basic Services

OBCs consistently underscored the lack of affordable healthcare, shortage of schools and teachers, and minimal scholarship options for higher education. Remote barangays find it difficult to access routine medical care, reliable water supply, or an integrated Madrasah curriculum that merges Islamic and national learning.  

3. Institutional and Governance Challenges 

Multiple communities described feeling excluded from development planning and resource distribution. The absence of formal channels to convey local priorities to government authorities generates unmet needs and duplications in assistance programs.  

4. Cultural and Religious Preservation

Many OBCs desire strengthened Madrasah education, cultural events, and the documentation of oral traditions. Leaders and elders worry that younger generations drift away from Bangsamoro heritage due to limited support for religious and cultural centers.  

5. Positive Factors 

Data show that women’s cooperatives, youth associations, and local councils remain eager to participate in capacity-building programs. Established religious authorities also retain moral influence, making them valuable partners in rolling out government-led or donor-supported initiatives.

### Accomplishments and Ongoing Efforts

The Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (OOBC) has convened regional consultations in Pagadian City, Ipil, Davao, General Santos, and Palawan, providing first-hand insights into OBC conditions. These sessions confirmed demands for expanded social services, improved roads, institutional reforms, and Halal-focused livelihood options. A subsequent MANA process in Regions IX and XII supplied quantitative and qualitative data on population distribution, poverty incidence, and local economies. These findings enabled the OOBC to formulate evidence-based recommendations, collaborate with local governments on pilot programs, and propose further expansions of BARMM services to remote areas.

### Policy and Program Recommendations

This document presents ten core policy and program recommendations tailored to the needs of OBCs. Each recommendation sets forth practical measures, supported by key considerations that emphasize cultural sensitivity, inclusive governance, and resource sharing among government agencies, civil society, and donors.

1.	Scholarships and Financial Assistance for Higher Education Learners
Establish or expand scholarship programs for OBC youth who struggle with educational expenses. This intervention encourages underprivileged families to send their children to universities or technical institutes, cultivating a generation of skilled professionals who can support local development.

2.	Support to OBC Madaris 
Provide honoraria for Islamic teachers (asatidz) and grant financial aid to Madrasah institutions to strengthen faith-based education while integrating secular subject matter. Structured Madrasah systems address high dropout rates and ensure that religious instruction aligns with national learning standards.

3.	Support to OBC Halal Enterprise Development
Focus on microfinance and Islamic finance models that stimulate Halal agriculture, fisheries, and other economic endeavors. Technical and vocational training in processing, marketing, and certification procedures would enable cooperatives to enter premium markets and lift household incomes.

4.	Expansion of Social Services (TABANG, AMBAG, KAPYANAN) to OBCs
Extend Bangsamoro Government–sponsored relief and assistance programs, such as medical aid and housing subsidies, to communities outside the BARMM. Tailored eligibility, simplified applications, and on-site registration drives increase the accessibility of these social services.

5.	Cultural Development Program for OBCs
Revitalize threatened traditions, crafts, and languages through small grants, local festivals, and cultural mapping activities. Incorporating local history into school curricula and encouraging cross-regional exchanges unify dispersed Moro communities and preserve Bangsamoro heritage across generations.

6.	Women and Youth Development Program
Offer leadership training, financial literacy, and livelihood support to empower women and youth as active participants in local governance and economic ventures. Initiatives such as safe resource centers and mentoring circles strengthen grassroots innovation and social stability.

7.	Tourism Development Program for OBCs
Capitalize on scenic landscapes and cultural richness by organizing heritage events, training local guides, and establishing basic visitor amenities. Safeguard ecologically sensitive areas and highlight authentic Moro traditions to attract sustainable, low-impact tourism that enriches the local population.

8.	Infrastructure Development for OBCs
Upgrade roads, bridges, water systems, and power supply in remote barangays. Integrate disaster-resilient designs to protect these facilities from natural hazards. Improved infrastructure lowers transport costs, encourages medical outreach, and makes small businesses more viable.

9.	Increased Participation of OBCs in Governance and Development Planning
Formalize channels that bring OBC leaders into budgeting and policy formulation. Holding regular consultation forums, providing governance training, and rotating meeting venues reinforce community trust and ensure alignment with the Bangsamoro Government’s broader plans.

10.	Institutional Partnerships and Coordination Mechanisms for OBC Development
Streamline cooperation among BARMM ministries, local governments, national agencies, and civil society to prevent overlapping interventions or neglected barangays. Mechanisms such as memoranda of agreement, shared data portals, and designated OOBC focal points facilitate timely, accountable collaboration.

 
### Next Steps

Implementing these proposals hinges on official endorsements from legislative and executive authorities within the Bangsamoro Government, incorporation into annual investment plans, and dynamic coordination with external entities such as LGUs, national departments, and development organizations. Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems, orchestrated by the OOBC, will track progress against target indicators—enrollment figures, poverty reduction, or improved water access—to gauge their practical impact on everyday life. Local leaders, religious figures, and youth organizations are viewed as indispensable allies in ensuring that policy interventions remain culturally appropriate and community-led.

Steadfast collaboration, continuous community engagement, and transparent feedback loops will allow these recommendations to transition from plan to reality. The OOBC’s mission is to represent and serve all Bangsamoro communities, regardless of geographic boundaries, reaffirming the principle that the Bangsamoro struggle unites people across Mindanao’s diverse landscapes. By adopting these strategies, the Bangsamoro Government can advance inclusive growth, reinforce cultural pride, and honor its responsibility to promote the common good of the entire Bangsamoro nation.
 
## INTRODUCTION

This document outlines a comprehensive approach to addressing the challenges and opportunities of Bangsamoro communities living outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). These Other Bangsamoro Communities share a distinct identity based on Islamic beliefs, cultural traditions, and a common historical experience. Although they maintain these ties, they fall outside BARMM’s official jurisdiction. Many reside in Regions IX and XII, as well as other provinces and cities with sizable but often underserved Muslim populations. Limited school infrastructure, constrained access to medical care, substandard roads, and inadequate livelihood programs create persistent socio-economic gaps that require coordinated governance strategies.

The OOBC under the Office of the Chief Minister leads consultations, conducts socio-economic mapping, and recommends specific programs for these communities. Engagements held in Pagadian City, Ipil, Davao City, General Santos City, and Palawan highlighted the need for accessible healthcare, sustainable livelihoods, Halal industry development, official recognition of Madrasah education, and cultural preservation. Local government units, national agencies, and BARMM ministries have responded by expanding service delivery in areas that previously found it difficult to benefit from BARMM-led programs.

Recent MANA activities in Regions IX and XII revealed infrastructure gaps, underfunded agricultural support, fragmented social protection, and inadequate market access for local products. These conditions especially affect farmers in remote barangays, fisherfolk with limited coastal infrastructure, small entrepreneurs seeking capital, and traditional weavers who rely on unstable demand for artisanal crafts. MANA findings also revealed encouraging factors, including respected local leadership structures, vibrant women’s cooperatives, and youth groups eager to engage in training opportunities. These strengths serve as a foundation for designing culturally responsive policies that promote moral governance and inclusive development.

Ongoing interagency collaboration—uniting local government units, BARMM ministries, civil society organizations, and private sector partners—aims to ensure that no Bangsamoro community is neglected. This document examines the progress of these interventions, summarizes the range of programs reaching Other Bangsamoro Communities, and offers data-based recommendations for sustaining and scaling up current efforts. Policymakers and stakeholders will find these insights useful in protecting the fundamental rights of Bangsamoro people, promoting economic resilience, and preserving cultural integrity across all areas where Bangsamoro communities reside.

 
## MANDATE ON OTHER BANGSAMORO COMMUNITIES

The Bangsamoro Government's mandate concerning OBCs is explicitly defined within the broader framework of its establishment through the BOL. While the BOL primarily focuses on the establishment of the BARMM, it also recognizes the existence and needs of Bangsamoro people residing outside the region's defined territory. This recognition stems from an understanding that the Bangsamoro identity and community extend beyond the formal boundaries of the BARMM, encompassing a diverse population with historical, cultural, and familial connections.

The core of the Bangsamoro Government’s mandate is to ensure the welfare and development of all Bangsamoro people, irrespective of their geographical location. This commitment is rooted in the BOL's declaration of principles, which aims to secure the identity and posterity of the Bangsamoro people and allow for their meaningful self-governance within the framework of the Philippine Constitution. It also emphasizes the importance of a self-reliant and independent regional economy that is responsive to the needs of all Bangsamoro people.

Specifically, Section 12, Article VI of the BOL directly addresses the situation of OBCs. This section mandates that:

- The National Government shall ensure the protection of the rights of the Bangsamoro people residing in communities outside the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region and undertake programs for their rehabilitation and development.

- The Bangsamoro Government, in coordination with local government units where these communities are located and the appropriate national government agencies, shall provide assistance to enhance their economic, social, and cultural development.

This provision establishes a clear responsibility for both the National Government and the Bangsamoro Government to actively address the needs of OBCs. It moves beyond a purely territorial perspective and acknowledges that the Bangsamoro people’s welfare is a collective responsibility, irrespective of their place of residence. This mandate acknowledges that these communities, despite not being included in the core territory of the BARMM, are an integral part of the Bangsamoro population, thus requiring special attention and support. The mandate recognizes that these communities face unique challenges regarding political representation, access to resources, and inclusion in national and regional development programs.

The mandate for the Bangsamoro Government to assist OBCs is further reinforced by the general principles of the BOL. The BOL emphasizes that governance in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region is a responsibility of the duly elected civilian government, tasked with promoting unity, peace, justice, and goodwill among all peoples. The government must also ensure the provision of basic necessities and equal opportunities in life. The provision of social justice is promoted in all aspects of life and phases of development in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region. The Bangsamoro Government, as the governing body for all Bangsamoro people, must thus extend its efforts to communities outside the BARMM.

To operationalize this mandate for OBCs, Bangsamoro Autonomy Act (BAA) No. 13, or the Bangsamoro Administrative Code, established the Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities (OOBC) within the Office of the Chief Minister (OCM). This move underscores the significance the Bangsamoro Government places on addressing the needs of OBCs. The OOBC serves as the primary unit within the OCM that is specifically responsible for matters concerning OBCs. The OOBC’s creation is rooted in the recognition that OBCs require a dedicated office to address their unique situations.

The mandate of the OOBC is specifically defined in the Bangsamoro Administrative Code:

- Primary Unit for Policy and Program Recommendation: The OOBC is the primary unit in the OCM that recommends policies and systematic programs for promoting the welfare of Bangsamoro communities outside the region. This includes identifying and proposing solutions to address their economic, social, and cultural development needs.

- Coordination with Stakeholders: The OOBC is mandated to coordinate with local government units (LGUs), national government agencies (NGAs), and Bangsamoro ministries, offices, and agencies (BMOAs). This coordination is intended to facilitate access to existing programs and services, advocate for the creation of new initiatives to address specific needs, and ensure effective collaboration for interventions that promote social, economic, and cultural development of the OBCs.

- Information Gathering and Needs Assessment: The OOBC is tasked to gather information and assess the economic, social, and cultural needs of OBCs. This involves the collection of data from primary and secondary sources to evaluate their conditions. The information gathered is intended to serve as the basis for formulating evidence-based policies and interventions. The OOBC is also tasked to conduct consultations and mapping and needs assessments (MANA) for the OBCs to fulfill its mandate. The consultations are to gather inputs, address concerns, and integrate community insights into the programs and services of the Bangsamoro Government for the OBCs.

- Other Functions: The OOBC may also perform other functions as may be directed by the Chief Minister or other proper authorities. This provision allows the OOBC to adapt to emerging needs and challenges related to the OBCs.

It is important to note that the OOBC is primarily a recommendatory and coordinating body. It does not have the authority to directly implement programs and services; rather, it serves as a bridge between the OBCs and the different ministries and offices of the BARMM government. The OOBC also facilitates partnerships between and among different stakeholders to address the needs of OBCs and advocates for mainstreaming of OBC concerns in the policies and programs of LGUs and NGAs.


 
## ACCOMPLISHED PROGRAMS, ACTIVITIES, AND PROJECTS (PAPs)

### Initial Community Engagement and Office Inception

The OOBC began formal operations in early 2022. It introduced its mandate through informal meetings with community elders and local officials in several municipalities adjacent to the BARMM. These preliminary engagements clarified the OOBC’s role as a recommendatory and coordinating entity rather than a direct implementer of large-scale development projects. The office secured basic contact details of local government units and sectoral representatives, then scheduled area-specific consultations to better understand the contexts and needs of OBCs.

### Consultations in Ipil, June 2022

OOBC personnel organized a two-day consultation in Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay, on June 14–15, 2022. Around one hundred participants attended, representing youth groups, women’s associations, Madrasah teachers, farmers’ cooperatives, and local government officers. Stakeholders identified inadequate roads to rural barangays as a leading constraint, followed by struggles in accessing hospital services outside Ipil’s main center. Discussions focused on possible partnerships with the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Public Works in BARMM. Participants expressed hope that the OOBC could bridge them to relevant agencies, especially in crafting scholarship programs and improving microfinancing support.

### Consultations in Pagadian City, August 2022

A follow-up meeting took place in Pagadian City, Zamboanga del Sur, from August 22–23, 2022. More than one hundred fifty participants joined workshops, including ulama, youth leaders, barangay captains, and business owners. Local officials and farmers reported difficulties in transporting produce, citing deteriorated farm-to-market roads and unpredictable power supplies. Mothers shared concerns about high dropout rates and the challenges of integrating Madrasah instruction into the formal curriculum. The OOBC compiled these inputs and produced a summary that informed its subsequent coordination strategy with BARMM ministries dealing with infrastructure, education, and livelihood projects.

### Consultations in Davao City, February 2023

A larger gathering occurred in Davao City on February 18, 2023, bringing together roughly two hundred representatives from OBCs across the Davao Region. Community members described issues that ranged from limited Madrasah education for newly converted Muslims to deep-seated poverty in rural barangays. The meeting highlighted insufficient institutional support—particularly from local or national agencies—until the establishment of the OOBC. Religious leaders endorsed proposals for more cohesive religious training programs and formal recognition of Islamic teachers under a unified Bangsamoro educational framework. Representatives of women’s groups also urged ongoing dialogue with the OOBC, stressing the need for targeted livelihood programs aimed at single mothers in impoverished districts.

### Consultations in General Santos City, March 2023

Another major consultation took place in General Santos City on March 16, 2023. Political and social leaders from neighboring municipalities, including Sultan Kudarat and parts of South Cotabato, contributed insights. Attendees explained that remote barangays, mostly engaged in fishing and small-scale agriculture, lacked resources for scaling up economic ventures. Parents and educators revisited calls for scholarships, better Madrasah integration, and improved coordination with local government offices to address pressing social service gaps. The OOBC announced plans to deliver a consolidated report to BARMM line agencies and indicated it would remain in touch with city authorities for follow-ups on livelihood and healthcare needs.

### Coordination in Palawan, September 2023

From September 10–16, 2023, the OOBC organized a series of meetings in Palawan with the involvement of officials from the Office of the Wali and a Member of Parliament. Local chief executives, municipal officers, and barangay leaders gathered to explore the potential extension of Bangsamoro government programs—particularly healthcare and livelihood interventions—to island and mainland communities. Dialogue centered on formalizing partnerships to roll out the Ayudang Medikal Mula sa Bangsamoro Government (AMBAG) initiative in remote localities. Participants agreed that service delivery requires memoranda of agreement tailored to the unique geography of Palawan. The OOBC also noted that collecting accurate demographic information for scattered populations remains critical to ensure inclusion in future Bangsamoro-funded efforts.

### Mapping and Needs Assessments (MANA), 2024

The OOBC launched the Mapping and Needs Assessments (MANA) in 2024, targeting Regions IX and XII, where many Bangsamoro communities reside outside the official BARMM territory. Field teams gathered a mix of qualitative and quantitative data, assisted by local enumerators and verified through desk reviews and validation workshops. The MANA reports revealed key social, economic, and cultural indicators, confirming the magnitude of healthcare limitations, educational gaps, and livelihood struggles. Community validation sessions helped refine these findings. The collected information now guides the OOBC in formulating evidence-based proposals for BARMM ministries and supporting local stakeholders who require assistance in healthcare planning, microfinance, scholarship programs, and religious education enhancements.

 
### Impact and Ongoing Plans

These accomplished programs, activities, and projects exemplify how the OOBC has moved from initial outreach to structured data collection and formal coordination with government partners. The regular consultations allowed OBCs to voice their priorities, including infrastructure improvements, livelihood generation, and cultural preservation. The MANA efforts produced deeper insights into local conditions, enabling the OOBC to channel well-founded policy advice to the BARMM leadership. Coordination meetings in Palawan and other areas introduced clear commitments for service delivery. Community members now expect more systematic follow-ups, which the OOBC aims to fulfill through continued liaison work, monitoring of agreed initiatives, and engagement with relevant BARMM ministries. This cycle of consultation, mapping, coordination, and follow-up aligns with the OOBC’s mandate to act as a responsive and reliable link between OBCs and the Bangsamoro Government, ensuring that communities beyond BARMM receive meaningful support for their development aspirations.

 
## OBC DATA 

The consultations, coordination meetings, and MANA initiatives yielded detailed quantitative and qualitative findings about Other Bangsamoro Communities (OBCs) in Regions IX and XII. The demographics reveal that these communities have a pronounced presence in both regions, but each area presents distinct patterns of population distribution, poverty incidence, and social service gaps.

### REGION IX OBC DATA
(MANA Findings and Data from Consultations in Pagadian City and Ipil)

This section presents the demographic information about Other Bangsamoro Communities (OBCs) in Region IX, incorporating statistics compiled through a formal Mapping and Needs Assessment (MANA) initiative and verified by local leaders during consultations in Pagadian City (October 11, 2022) and Ipil (December 3, 2022). The data below focus strictly on population totals, approximate poverty levels, and the geographic distribution of Muslim communities. Any identified social service gaps or developmental concerns are discussed separately under OBC Needs.

#### Overall Demographics and Population Distribution

Region IX, also referred to as the Zamboanga Peninsula, encompasses more than 3.8 million people. Roughly 700,000 identify as Muslim, equating to about 18 percent of the region’s total population. Demographic data from MANA and local municipal records indicate that many of these Muslim-majority groups reside in coastal or interior barangays with limited road connectivity.

Table 1. Population Data for Region IX (Zamboanga Peninsula)
Province/City	Total Population	% Muslim
Zamboanga Peninsula (Overall)	3,862,588	18.22
Zamboanga del Norte	1,046,017	7.03
Zamboanga del Sur	1,048,402	6.90
Zamboanga Sibugay	668,648	15.94
Zamboanga City	969,391	37.62
Isabela de Basilan	130,130	66.60

Representatives in Pagadian City and Ipil validated these official figures by comparing them with local government registries and barangay enumerations. Consultations revealed that Zamboanga City and Isabela de Basilan host higher percentages of Muslim residents, while Zamboanga del Norte, Zamboanga del Sur, and Zamboanga Sibugay exhibit smaller, though still significant, Muslim populations spread across multiple municipalities.

 
#### Poverty Incidence and Socio-Economic Indicators

Quantitative data from the MANA project show considerable differences in poverty incidence throughout Region IX. Zamboanga del Norte has one of the highest poverty rates in the Philippines at around 50.80 percent, whereas Zamboanga City’s is closer to six percent. Zamboanga del Sur hovers near 18.30 percent, and Zamboanga Sibugay stands at about 34 percent. Residents in Pagadian City and Ipil confirmed that families in hinterland or coastal barangays are especially vulnerable due to sparse economic opportunities and greater travel costs to local markets. These approximate poverty percentages are summarized in the figure below:

Figure 1.
 

This numerical profile offered by the MANA exercise helps contextualize OBC living situations but does not fully address infrastructure quality, job availability, or resource distribution. Residents frequently combine subsistence agriculture with minimal off-farm activities, although municipal records are yet quantify this precisely.

#### Geographic Spread of OBC Communities

Both the MANA field teams and participants at the Pagadian and Ipil consultations reported that concentrated Moro populations exist in specific municipalities of each province. In Zamboanga del Norte, Sirawai, Sibuco, and Siocon contain large clusters of OBCs. Zamboanga del Sur hosts Muslim communities in Labangan, Dinas, Dimataling, and Kumalarang, among others. In Zamboanga Sibugay, barangays in Tungawan, Ipil, and Naga carry a notable Moro demographic. Barangay captains in Ipil mentioned population growth in certain coastal barangays, partly due to the migration of families seeking fishing opportunities or farmland near river basins.

 
### REGION XII OBC DATA
(MANA Findings and Data from Consultation in General Santos City)

This section highlights demographic information regarding Other Bangsamoro Communities (OBCs) in Region XII, also known as SOCCSKSARGEN. The data below stem from a Mapping and Needs Assessment (MANA) initiative and local clarifications offered during a multi-stakeholder consultation held in General Santos City on March 16, 2023. These figures focus solely on population distribution, approximate poverty rates, and broad socio-economic features; any discussion of constraints or requests voiced by community members appears in a separate needs-oriented section.

Overall Demographics and Population Distribution

Region XII comprises the provinces of South Cotabato, Cotabato (North Cotabato), Sultan Kudarat, Sarangani, and the major urban center of General Santos City. The overall population exceeds 4.3 million, with approximately 15 percent self-identifying as Muslim. The following table shows approximate totals and the estimated percentage of Muslim residents by province and city:

Table 2. Population data for Region XII (SOCCSKSARGEN)
Province/City	Total Population	% Muslim
Region XII (Overall)	4,351,773	15.76
Cotabato (North Cotabato)	1,273,594	19.32
South Cotabato	973,146	5.40
Sultan Kudarat	851,554	30.27
Sarangani	558,069	11.03
Gen. Santos City	695,410	9.77

Data derived from the MANA process indicate that significant Moro populations inhabit various coastal and upland barangays in North Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and Sarangani. Households in these localities typically rely on a combination of small-scale agriculture and fisheries, often complicated by distances to urban economic centers.

#### Consultation in General Santos City

A regional consultation in General Santos City allowed local leaders, Ulama, youth councils, and women’s groups to refine or verify existing population statistics. City planning records show Muslim residents making up around 9 to 10 percent of General Santos City’s total inhabitants, clustered primarily in peripheral barangays. Participants also offered anecdotal information on migration patterns, suggesting that some families displaced from rural provinces converge on General Santos in search of work or educational opportunities. While precise figures on this internal migration remain incomplete, the event substantiated the region’s broad numeric outlines.

#### Poverty Incidence and Socio-Economic Indicators

Region XII’s poverty incidence varies across provinces, reflecting a range of local agricultural or commercial activities. North Cotabato shows around 19 percent of families living below the poverty line, while Sultan Kudarat approaches 30 percent. Sarangani stands at approximately 11 percent, and General Santos City is near 9 percent. The figure below offers a simple depiction of these estimates:

Figure 2.
 

Though these rates do not isolate OBC households specifically, local enumerators underlined that Muslim-majority barangays frequently overlap with less-developed zones. Farmers in mountainous or remote areas have limited infrastructure to support irrigation or post-harvest handling, while fisherfolk in coastal barangays report insufficient ports or cold storage.

#### Geographic Spread of OBC Communities

The MANA activity and General Santos City consultation confirmed that OBC clusters appear in a variety of settings: inland barangays with limited water and electricity, and maritime communities along Sarangani Bay. For instance, Sarangani’s eastern municipalities include high concentrations of Moro families who rely on artisanal fishing or coconut cultivation. Sultan Kudarat’s interior, by contrast, hosts both Islamic leaders and migratory farmers with land-tenure complexities. Large-scale plantation agriculture in parts of North Cotabato also influences local demographics, though the precise figure available on the proportion of Moro laborers in those operations are yet to be determined.
 
## OBC NEEDS

REGION IX (ZAMBOANGA PENINSULA): MOST PRESSING OBC NEEDS

1.	Infrastructure and Utility Services

Infrastructure challenges, particularly dilapidated roads and inconsistent electricity, emerged as a primary concern for many OBCs. Remote barangays in Pagadian and Ipil described how crumbling farm-to-market routes and limited power supplies prevented them from accessing markets, schools, and health facilities. Community members repeatedly emphasized that poor infrastructure drives up transportation costs, deters qualified professionals from living in rural areas, and constrains both small businesses and personal mobility. Participants frequently cited roads, bridges, and stable utilities as the foundation needed to strengthen all other development priorities.

2.	Economic Development and Livelihood Opportunities

Pervasive poverty, especially in parts of Zamboanga del Norte with a 50.80% poverty rate, led many to identify economic hardship as a top issue. Families explained that the lack of stable income, limited access to capital, and weak market linkages hindered their ability to expand small farms or fisheries. Attendees in remote barangays stressed that unreliable utilities and poor roads made farming and trading unprofitable. Requests for business development support, microfinance programs, and training in Halal-focused ventures underscored the need to move beyond subsistence-level livelihoods toward sustainable growth.

3.	Educational Shortfalls

Teachers, parents, and local officials consistently described the daily challenges caused by inadequate school buildings, underqualified teaching staff, and scarce scholarship opportunities. Many families explained that students dropped out early due to long travel on rugged roads or the absence of nearby schools. Madrasah integration also emerged as a pressing concern, since many Moro communities wanted religious instruction to be recognized within mainstream curricula. Participants highlighted the need for strong partnerships between local government units, communities, and the Bangsamoro Government to improve secular and Islamic education.

4.	Healthcare Services

Healthcare gaps frequently surfaced during consultations. Mothers and infants in distant barangays often suffered from limited clinics, few medical supplies, and few trained professionals. Discussions in Ipil included examples of emergency care delays caused by road inaccessibility, which further raised travel costs. Many OBCs feel underserved by existing medical aid programs and hope for more inclusive coverage or regular mobile clinics. Suggestions included expanding maternal health monitoring, immunization drives, and collaboration among local health offices, OOBC, and national healthcare providers to reduce preventable illnesses.

5.	Social Services and Protection

Rising social issues, such as drug use in specific localities, teenage pregnancy, and inadequate safety nets for vulnerable groups, appeared in discussions across the region. Community members often expressed the need for youth-oriented programs and mental health support, especially where unemployment is high and recreational facilities are lacking. Women's cooperatives and elders requested targeted assistance that addresses domestic conflict resolution, entrepreneurial training, and other social welfare interventions. Participants emphasized that well-structured social services could help break cycles of poverty and community disunity.

6.	Environmental Management

Illegal fishing, deforestation, and susceptibility to natural disasters emerged in coastal and upland barangays, though these issues often took a back seat to more immediate livelihood and infrastructure needs. Some fishing communities reported declining marine stocks and the continued use of destructive fishing techniques. Farmers observed that erratic weather patterns and soil degradation had lowered crop yields. This underscored the importance of integrating environmental programs into broader development initiatives, so that resource depletion does not undermine future economic gains.

7.	Cultural Preservation and Identity

Local ulama, tribal elders, and traditional leaders consistently voiced concerns about fading cultural and religious traditions, especially as younger people left for urban centers. Communities wanted support for cultural centers and festivals, training for asatidz, and inclusion of indigenous practices in local events. Many saw cultural heritage as a core pillar of the Bangsamoro identity, but they also recognized that economic necessity and limited government engagement sometimes overshadowed long-term cultural investments. They advocated stronger coordination with schools, NGOs, and religious institutions to pass on languages, crafts, and ceremonies to the next generation.
 
REGION XII (SOCCSKSARGEN): MOST PRESSING OBC NEEDS

1.	Access to Basic Services 
 
Several consultations identified the scarcity of essential services—healthcare, education, water, and sanitation—as the principal obstacle facing many OBC communities. Families in remote areas find it difficult to obtain medical care and safe drinking water, while children must travel long distances to reach primary or secondary schools. Some communities rely on inadequate or outdated facilities, prompting urgent calls for upgraded clinics, additional educators, expanded scholarship initiatives, and clean water systems to raise overall living standards.

2.	Economic Development and Livelihood Support

Poverty remains pervasive in rural barangays across Region XII, fueling strong demands for sustainable farming, livestock assistance, microfinancing, and relevant training. Many families struggle to generate stable income because of limited access to capital, weak market linkages, or insufficient irrigation and post-harvest facilities. Community members view expanded livelihood programs—particularly in agriculture, fisheries, and Halal business ventures—as vital for reducing poverty and helping OBC households manage rising costs of basic goods.

3.	Infrastructure Development

Poor roads, deficient bridges, and unreliable transportation came up repeatedly in local assessments, especially in agricultural zones. OBC families say high transport costs discourage them from sending children to school or marketing their produce. Gaps in digital connectivity also hinder communication, e-learning, and links to outside businesses. Many participants recommended building or rehabilitating rural roads to improve economic prospects, integrate far-flung barangays, and bring vital public services closer to communities.

4.	Islamic Education and Cultural Preservation

Local leaders and Ulama circles emphasized that preserving the Bangsamoro identity requires structured Madrasah education and support for traditional customs. Young people, especially in outlying municipalities, sometimes do not have access to recognized Madrasah programs or resources for religious studies. Participants sought official recognition of Islamic curricula, along with cultural activities and festivals. They viewed these efforts as essential for sustaining intergenerational knowledge and strengthening social cohesion.


 

5.	Peace and Security

Stakeholders described the disruptive effects of rido (clan feuds), occasional armed skirmishes, and overall instability on daily life and economic ventures. Some communities endure lingering tensions over land or resources, forcing residents to abandon fields or cancel market trips. Consultations noted that consistent dialogue, conflict mediation, and closer coordination with security forces could reduce violence and foster an environment where development projects can proceed without fear.

6.	Political Representation and Governance

Community members widely noted that weak representation in local decision-making processes hampers OBCs from securing resources and guidance. They described how their concerns—ranging from school expansions to livelihood grants—remain overlooked if no dedicated channels exist to voice them. Many asked for formal mechanisms that empower them to articulate priorities and receive clearer support from government agencies. Stronger partnerships between OBC leaders, local governments, and the BARMM structure were seen as pivotal to inclusive development.

7.	Capacity Building and Skills Development

Leaders and educators in Region XII explained how limited technical expertise undercuts community efforts to manage cooperatives, develop microenterprises, and organize self-help programs. Vocational training, leadership seminars, and targeted workshops could help OBCs improve agricultural productivity, create local industries, and run formal associations. These capacity-building measures complement other development strategies by ensuring that communities possess the necessary skills to maintain and expand projects in the long term.

 
REGION XI (DAVAO): MOST PRESSING OBC NEEDS

1.	Education and Social Services

Education emerged as the top priority, with communities highlighting gaps in school access for Moro youth, especially in remote barangays. Many emphasized the lack of Madrasah education options for students and new Muslims, leading some families to withdraw children from schooling early. Participants also described limited social services for vulnerable groups, including the Balik Islam sector in Davao del Norte, who sometimes resorted to begging or had difficulty receiving public benefits. Several speakers suggested stronger scholarship support, more localized teaching facilities, and outreach programs targeting both traditional and Islamic education.

2.	Economic Development and Livelihood Programs

Economic instability ranked second, as many attendees cited pervasive poverty, limited job prospects, and insufficient capital for small-scale ventures. Some families indicated that meager opportunities forced them to seek alms during holiday seasons. Entrepreneurs and farmers alike wanted access to microfinance, halal industry initiatives, and sustainable projects that could raise incomes over the long term. References to small- and medium-enterprise development, along with cooperative-based ventures, underscored the desire to move beyond short-term relief toward building more stable local economies.

3.	Institutional Support and Coordination

Institutional support came third. Several discussions underlined how Bangsamoro groups struggled to secure consistent assistance from local government units and national agencies, partly because of weak representation or fragmented policy frameworks. Participants called for deeper collaboration among the BARMM government, the Office for Other Bangsamoro Communities, LGUs, and relevant departments. They viewed robust coordination mechanisms as key to better services and funding access, especially for OBCs that remain outside the core BARMM territory.

4.	Cultural and Religious Development

Communities viewed the preservation of local cultures and religious practices as essential. Many mentioned the need for Muslim cemeteries, more inclusive religious facilities, and training programs for asatidz. Participants also urged that newly designed projects align with cultural values and sensitivities. They emphasized that cultural preservation fosters community pride and maintains Moro identity, especially in areas where populations are geographically dispersed and fewer resources exist to sustain religious practices or indigenous customs.

5.	Health Services

Although healthcare issues matter greatly, participants raised them somewhat less frequently than education, livelihood, or institutional gaps. Some OBCs can still receive basic services through local LGUs or national programs, though these remain insufficient. Maternal care, immunization coverage, and preventive health measures were the main concerns, alongside calls for more local medical missions. Speakers recommended closer coordination between OOBC, municipal health offices, and existing government facilities to integrate basic healthcare within broader social programs.


 
PALAWAN: MOST PRESSING OBC NEEDS

1.	Healthcare Access and Support

Healthcare needs dominate local priorities, given recurring references to the AMBAG program and frequent concerns about medical assistance. Communities near Rizal described a district hospital with limited capacity to treat all patients, leaving many without timely care. Municipal officials and parliament members discussed the possibility of building additional facilities—potentially including sea ambulances to serve island barangays—which reflects the urgency of expanded healthcare coverage. Participants frequently pointed out that inaccessible clinics and a shortage of trained health workers hamper preventive measures, routine check-ups, and emergency interventions in remote locations.

2.	Educational Infrastructure

The scarcity of schools and resources in certain barangays emerged as a central issue. Stakeholders mentioned that only four Madrasas currently operate in Rizal, despite a substantial local Muslim population. Local leaders stressed the need for more Arabic/ALIVE teachers, better compensation packages, and scheduling that accommodates both formal and Islamic education. Many participants supported the mayor’s pledge to build additional Madrasas in each barangay, indicating strong demand for both secular and religious instruction to better equip Bangsamoro youth.

3.	Religious Infrastructure

Support for religious infrastructure, including mosques and community centers, drew high levels of attention. Community representatives decried the closure of Markaz Faroq, which once played a significant role in religious education and social gathering. Some turned to members of parliament for help constructing mosques or reopening previously established sites. Community ulama councils stressed that well-maintained religious facilities bolster identity, offer stable venues for prayer, and foster stronger connections among families spread across remote island barangays.

4.	Water Infrastructure

The lack of potable water was specifically identified as one of the main challenges facing island communities within the Bangsamoro areas of Palawan. This was highlighted during key discussions between Mr. Caril, Council of Leaders (COL) for BCOBAR, and other officials, who noted it as a fundamental infrastructure need affecting daily life. While the issue received less extensive discussion compared to other priorities in the coordination meetings, its mention as a "main issue" by leadership suggests its importance to community wellbeing. The challenge primarily affects island-based Bangsamoro communities, though specific details about the nature and extent of water access problems were not elaborated in the meetings.

5.	Support for Cultural Preservation

OBCs in Palawan consistently underscored the importance of safeguarding Bangsamoro heritage outside BARMM jurisdiction. Suggestions included creating a Peace Culture Center to preserve local customs and reinforce community identity. Programs that integrate Islamic Studies and Arabic Language featured prominently in these discussions, as speakers said cultural revitalization initiatives must go hand in hand with socio-economic support. This balance, they believed, would strengthen the sense of belonging for Moro families scattered across multiple municipalities.

6.	Economic Development

Livelihood-based strategies, such as leveraging funding from Arab countries or promoting fisheries and agriculture, were seen as solutions for raising living standards in conflict-affected or remote communities. Participants recognized that stable incomes and employment opportunities offer households the means to invest in education, healthcare, and social initiatives. Local officials and MP representatives alike shared ideas about helping fisherfolk, farmers, and small-scale entrepreneurs develop more resilient market links.

7.	Legal and Administrative Support

Participants called for institutional mechanisms that formalize relationships between OBC leaders and local government units. Ongoing investigations, such as the one involving Markaz Faroq, exemplify the complexities communities face when navigating legal processes without structured support. Residents in remote barangays spoke of difficulties in obtaining documentation or representation, which affected their access to regional programs. Effective legal frameworks and consistent coordination with municipal offices and BARMM ministries were highlighted as pivotal to resolving administrative hurdles and ensuring communities secure their rightful benefits.


 
POLICY AND PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS

Policy Recommendation 1. Scholarships and Financial Assistance for OBC Higher Education Learners

Scholarships and financial support remain indispensable for many OBC constituents who cannot afford the cost of higher education or vocational training. Numerous OBCs, especially those in outlying barangays or impoverished areas, see tuition and related expenses as insurmountable barriers. Introducing or expanding scholarship programs addresses the repeated calls from Pagadian, Ipil, Davao, General Santos, and Palawan consultations for better schooling options. It also follows the MANA data, which show high dropout rates and limited progression to tertiary institutions among the youth. This measure can significantly improve OBC living conditions by increasing graduates who return home as educators, public servants, or entrepreneurs. Strengthening the academic background of these learners contributes to a more knowledgeable community that can better participate in local governance, economic development, and cultural preservation.

Key Consideration 1.1
A well-defined selection process for awarding scholarships or stipends will ensure that deserving learners who meet financial-need and academic criteria are prioritized. Assessing household incomes, previous academic records, and endorsements from OBCs can help focus the program on genuinely underprivileged students.

Key Consideration 1.2
A simple, user-friendly application system benefits learners in isolated barangays or those with limited internet access. Submission windows can match the academic calendar, and outreach to secondary schools or local community leaders ensures that potential applicants do not miss deadlines.

Key Consideration 1.3
The coverage of travel costs, dorm allowances, and related fees can be built into scholarships for students residing far from universities or colleges. Such support recognizes that families in remote areas often struggle to send their children to city-based campuses.

Key Consideration 1.4
Encouraging or requiring community service commitments from scholarship recipients instills a sense of responsibility. Young graduates can then devote time to organizing tutorials for secondary students, assisting in local government offices, or helping Madrasah teachers, reinforcing their ties to the communities that supported their studies.

Key Consideration 1.5
Exploring partnerships with private donors, philanthropic foundations, and corporate social responsibility programs is important for sustainability. External funding can supplement budget allocations from the Bangsamoro Government. Close coordination with community-based, youth, and women’s organizations helps identify the learners who stand to benefit most.

Key Consideration 1.6
Monitoring academic progress through semester reports or site visits can help identify challenges early. Providing personalized counseling, academic support, or supplementary training ensures that students in Regions IX, XI, XII, and Palawan remain on track to complete their chosen courses.

Other factors to consider include the potential for bridging programs, such as remedial classes for learners coming from under-resourced high schools. Integration with job-placement or internship schemes can further enhance the employability of scholarship beneficiaries, transforming education support into tangible outcomes for the broader OBC population.

Policy Recommendation 2. Support to OBC Madaris 
Communities in Regions IX, XI, and XII, as well as in Palawan, consistently highlighted the need for a more structured and adequately financed Madrasah system. Madaris often lack sufficient resources to sustain teacher salaries or develop up-to-date curricula. Providing honoraria for asatidz and small grants for Madrasah institutions meets a direct appeal from local ulama and parents, who value faith-based education alongside modern academic content. Strengthening Madaris fosters higher literacy rates and preserves moral and cultural traditions among Moro youth, ultimately reinforcing the communities’ identity and increasing the alignment between educational offerings and local needs.
Key Consideration 2.1
Setting up a standardized scheme for teacher honoraria ensures that asatidz are compensated in a fair, predictable manner. Clear guidelines on eligibility, teaching hours, and performance standards help maintain quality instruction and boost teacher retention in remote barangays. Asatidz who are already receiving support from other BARMM programs shall be ineligible.
Key Consideration 2.2
Coordinating with the Ministry of Basic, Higher, and Technical Education (MBHTE), the Department of Education (DepEd), and local education institutions guarantees that Madrasah curricula can integrate mainstream subjects. This approach appeals to families hoping their children will gain both moral and cultural learning and essential academic skills.
Key Consideration 2.3
Offering small financial subsidies for Madrasah operations allows institutions to upgrade facilities, purchase teaching materials, or invest in basic infrastructure. Madaris can channel the funds into priority areas such as library resources or improved sanitation, benefiting both asatidz and learners.
Key Consideration 2.4
Involving local religious organizations in the management of funds or teacher recruitment promotes transparency and assures the community that government support will align with moral and cultural values. Many OBCs expressed concern about upholding Islamic principles, especially if programs appear externally driven.
Key Consideration 2.5
Implementing routine monitoring and feedback encourages Madaris to report on student progress and administrative practices. Random site visits or scheduled reviews can capture learning outcomes, attendance patterns, and community satisfaction. This data helps policymakers refine incentives, teacher training, or curriculum enhancements.
Key Consideration 2.6
Including bridging programs for older children unfamiliar with basic Arabic or Islamic studies ensures that newly enrolled learners, such as Balik Islam youth, can catch up. Such inclusivity reflects the OBCs’ emphasis on welcoming everyone into faith-based learning, regardless of prior background.
Regularly revisiting how these subsidies and honoraria are allocated ensures that resources adapt to shifting student populations and economic conditions. Investments in Madrasah systems, when combined with overarching scholarship or organizational development programs, lay the groundwork for a more resilient and knowledgeable OBC society.

Policy Recommendation 3. Support to OBC Halal Enterprise Development
Agricultural producers and fisherfolk in Other Bangsamoro Communities frequently cite a lack of capital, marketing know-how, and certification guidance that hinders their ability to scale up in niche markets like Halal. Encouraging Halal enterprise development enhances livelihood options, opens broader commercial channels for farm outputs, and resonates strongly with families seeking Shariah-compliant financial models. This intervention resonates with the repeated calls from local enterpreneurs in Zamboanga del Sur, Davao City, and General Santos for more sustainable and culturally attuned economic initiatives. Increased Halal production enriches the economy of peripheral areas and strengthens ties between OBC producers and the larger Bangsamoro region, generating collective pride in Moro identity while tapping new revenue streams.
Key Consideration 3.1
Providing interest-free or profit-sharing microfinance ensures that the Islamic prohibition against riba is respected. Farmers or small-scale fisherfolk are more likely to participate in such financing arrangements if they see them as ethically aligned and supportive of communal well-being.
Key Consideration 3.2
Offering short vocational courses in food processing, packaging, and Halal certification procedures enables local entrepreneurs to improve product quality and meet market standards. Technical trainings that include basic bookkeeping or e-commerce skills can also diversify community income streams.
Key Consideration 3.3
Facilitating the formation of cooperatives or social enterprises, especially among women or youth groups, amplifies collective bargaining power and knowledge-sharing. These cooperatives and social enterprises can manage large orders, coordinate production schedules, and pool resources for marketing or equipment maintenance.
Key Consideration 3.4
Encouraging partnerships with both public and private entities that have experience in Halal certification—such as certification bodies, relevant government agencies, or large-scale Halal producers—helps new entrants meet regulatory demands. This coordination eases access to regional or global Halal markets.
Key Consideration 3.5
Establishing demonstration farms or pilot fisheries, under the guidance of agricultural or marine specialists, illustrates best practices in sustainable production. Local farmers and fishers can observe advanced irrigation methods, soil health improvements, or more efficient capturing techniques, all of which contribute to stable yields.
Key Consideration 3.6
Laying out a monitoring plan to track improvements in household incomes, cooperative membership, and product distribution networks ensures accountability. Regularly collecting feedback from entrepreneurs and local leaders clarifies whether the Halal initiatives align with evolving community needs.
Increasing Halal enterprise opportunities not only raises personal incomes but also enriches a community’s sense of cultural distinction. Families who see tangible benefits in running cooperatives or receiving seed grants gain motivation to strengthen ties with BARMM ministries and private stakeholders, thereby reinforcing overall economic resilience.
 
Policy Recommendation 4. Expansion of Social Services to OBCs (TABANG, AMBAG, and KAPYANAN)
Many OBCs have pointed out that government-supported social services rarely reach their localities. Extending programs such as TABANG (Tulong Alay sa Bangsamorong Nangangailangan), AMBAG (Ayudang Medikal Mula sa Bangsamoro Government), and KAPYANAN (a housing and socio-economic assistance initiative) responds directly to the recurring pleas heard during MANA activities as well as consultations in Pagadian, Ipil, Davao, and Palawan. Families living in remote barangays or conflict-affected areas benefit when relief and assistance measures become consistently available. Such expansions encourage communities to see themselves as integral parts of the Bangsamoro family, rather than peripheral groups with few ties to the center.
Key Consideration 4.1
Tailoring eligibility guidelines ensures that assistance goes to genuinely vulnerable households. Linking up with OBC organizations, local government units, social workers, and health officials verifies who merits immediate relief, which prevents duplication and minimizes misuse of funds.
Key Consideration 4.2
Adopting a user-friendly application procedure helps families in rural barangays who may face literacy barriers or lack of internet access. Approachable documentation requirements raise the likelihood that OBCs apply for and actually receive these social services, which can be lifesaving in times of crises or hardship.
Key Consideration 4.3
Coordinating visits with local leaders can include quick registration drives, counseling sessions for newly enrolled beneficiaries, and orientation on how to keep track of entitlements. Regular updates and onsite monitoring build trust and demonstrate accountability in how resources are allocated.
Key Consideration 4.4
Allocating local staff or focal persons in OBC-rich municipalities fosters better follow-through. Families often face transport difficulties and high travel costs to government offices, making proximity a key factor. These focal persons can keep a database of prospective beneficiaries and help them navigate complex processes.
Key Consideration 4.5
Maintaining a feedback or complaints hotline reassures residents that any oversight will be taken seriously. Consulted OBC members, for instance, referred to prior incidents where they felt unheard when reporting errors in beneficiary lists or distribution glitches. A transparent response mechanism resolves issues swiftly and upholds community confidence.
Expanding TABANG, AMBAG, and KAPYANAN to OBCs injects immediate relief into challenged locales while nurturing a sense of unity within the broader Bangsamoro region. These services, when well coordinated with local governments, generate widespread goodwill and demonstrate how the BARMM structure can stand behind communities beyond its formal borders.

Policy Recommendation 5. Cultural Development Program for OBCs
Conversations in both urban centers like Davao City and more remote localities such as Palawan highlighted the gradual erosion of Moro cultural heritage when younger generations move away or focus on mainstream educational paths. A dedicated cultural development program, aimed at preserving traditional practices, oral histories, languages, and unique crafts, offers a solution. Communities attested that festivals, capacity-building for local artists, and small grants for traditional craft-making revitalize customs and strengthen local identity. Emphasizing cultural value also boosts tourism potential and deepens the intergenerational bond that sustains Moro identity.
Key Consideration 5.1
Establishing local culture committees that include elders, cultural practitioners, and youth leaders encourages collective planning of celebrations or exhibits. Their authority ensures that events represent the community’s genuine heritage. Volunteers from youth groups can learn traditions, weaving skills, or oral storytelling techniques before they fade.
Key Consideration 5.2
Creating space within the educational framework for cultural immersion addresses one of the urgent appeals from consultations. Teachers can incorporate local history modules or short cultural segments, helping students develop pride and deeper knowledge of the Bangsamoro identity.
Key Consideration 5.3
Providing small-scale funding for festivals, heritage centers, or museums energizes local craftsmanship. Artisans can host workshops that showcase weaving, carving, or traditional cooking, turning these events into an intergenerational exchange where elders teach younger residents. Proceeds from festival sales may support ongoing maintenance or expansions of cultural activities.
Key Consideration 5.4
Promoting cross-regional cultural exchanges—where communities in Regions IX, XI, and XII can visit each other—strengthens the broad sense of a shared Bangsamoro heritage. These exchanges allow cultural workers to swap best practices, unify interpretive standards, and celebrate diversity within Bangsamoro communities scattered across Mindanao and the islands.
Key Consideration 5.5
Introducing cultural tourism initiatives in partnership with local government units or private investors can offer additional income for communities. Clear guidelines make sure these endeavors remain sensitive to religious and traditional values, avoiding commercial exploitation of sacred customs.
A structured cultural development program fosters resilience and pride in Bangsamoro heritage. Young people find renewed interest in their roots and become more eager to remain in or return to their home barangays. Documenting and preserving intangible cultural assets—while allowing for healthy evolution—ensures that Bangsamoro identity remains vibrant across each generation.

Policy Recommendation 6. Women and Youth Development Program in OBCs
Women and youth in OBCs often experience barriers to stable livelihoods, leadership opportunities, and social engagement, as documented in the MANA findings and consultations in Regions IX, XI, and XII. A well-designed women and youth development program addresses these obstacles by focusing on leadership skills, entrepreneurship training, and relevant social support. Participants in Davao City and General Santos consultations emphasized that such initiatives could help reduce women and youth issues, break cycles of poverty, and harness the energy of the younger population in remote barangays. Fostering stronger roles for women and youth aligns with broader Bangsamoro objectives of inclusive governance and sustainable economic growth.
Key Consideration 6.1
Introducing short-term courses in financial literacy or vocational skills empowers women and young adults to launch or manage small-scale businesses, especially in agri-based and marketing cooperatives, social enterprises, or retail trading. These courses should be flexible and accessible, accommodating household or farming schedules.
Key Consideration 6.2
Setting up safe community centers or resource hubs supports social interactions and group projects. Co-working spaces for digital activities can be helpful, while women’s associations could benefit from dedicated areas for product demonstrations and shared childcare support.
Key Consideration 6.3
Connecting participants with local mentors enhances motivation and retention. Experienced leaders within the community or nearby towns can guide them on navigating cultural and bureaucratic hurdles to achieve their personal or professional goals.
Key Consideration 6.4
Coordinating with barangay authorities, religious leaders, and local NGOs deepens community acceptance. This cooperation reassures traditional elders that programs respecting cultural values will help young Bangsamoro women and men assume constructive roles in local affairs.
Key Consideration 6.5
Embedding conflict-resolution and peace-building modules in leadership and self-development workshops may decrease “rido” (family feud) or youth-related violence. Encouraging youth to serve as mediators or to promote intergenerational dialogue strengthens social cohesion.
A robust women and youth development program stimulates community-led innovation and draws on the potential of a demographic that often goes underutilized. By equipping them with marketable skills, leadership confidence, and social support, OBC populations become more vibrant, interconnected, and resilient to shifts in economic or social landscapes.

Policy Recommendation 7. Tourism Development Program for OBCs
Many OBC locations possess natural beauty, cultural festivities, or historic sites that can attract visitors. Community discussions in Pagadian City, Palawan, and Ipil revealed interest in tourism as a path to new income. A tourism development program for OBCs offers a structured approach: improving basic amenities, training local guides, curating cultural events, and safeguarding ecological assets. Such an effort enriches local economies, encourages pride in Bangsamoro heritage, and fosters better appreciation of cultural identity for both residents and guests.
Key Consideration 7.1
Carrying out tourism mapping exercises identifies each OBC’s distinctive draws, such as scenic coastlines, caves, waterfalls, crafts, or culinary traditions. This mapping ensures local communities themselves decide which sites are appropriate to share, preserving sacred or ecologically sensitive areas.
Key Consideration 7.2
Offering training in hospitality, eco-guiding, or basic marketing helps OBC families convert existing resources (like spare rooms for homestays, fishing boats for island tours) into viable enterprises. Encouraging women and youth to lead tourism cooperatives and social enterprises amplify the program’s inclusivity.
 
Key Consideration 7.3
Mobilizing heritage festivals or cultural showcases revitalizes intangible Moro customs (dance, music, weaving, or cooking). These events draw visitors seeking authentic experiences and give local artisans a market for their crafts. Clear guidelines, shaped by ulama and elders, ensure no sensitive rituals are exploited.
Key Consideration 7.4
Improving roads, water, and sanitation infrastructure in potential tourist spots offers a dual benefit: OBC residents gain better living conditions, and tourists receive a safe, comfortable stay. Involving relevant government agencies such as the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) in initial development ensures planning that includes scenic routes or viewpoints.
Key Consideration 7.5
Promoting awareness of environmental safeguards, such as controlling plastics or avoiding destructive fishing, prevents ecological degradation from overshadowing the benefits of tourism. Coordination with conservation groups or the Ministry of Environment, Natural Resources and Energy (MENRE) sets clear guidelines for preserving natural resources.
A tourism development program rooted in local leadership and mindful of ecological and cultural boundaries can provide fresh revenue streams and strengthen intergenerational ties in OBC communities. Residents who find dignity and profits in showcasing their homeland’s heritage build greater unity and understanding between Bangsamoro and national or international visitors.

Policy Recommendation 8. Infrastructure Development for OBCs
Many OBCs live in remote areas that endure unreliable roads, scarce utilities, and minimal public transport links. Consultations in Zamboanga del Sur, Zamboanga Sibugay, Davao, and General Santos revealed that farmers struggle to bring produce to market, while families spend excessive time and money on travel for healthcare or schooling. Strengthening roads, electrification, and water systems helps communities access essential services and fosters local economic growth. This measure aligns with the goals identified in the MANA activities that show how upgrading infrastructure reduces cost-of-living pressures and improves quality of life.
Key Consideration 8.1
Focusing initial improvements on critical farm-to-market roads directly boosts household incomes and encourages farmers to expand production. Local community leaders can identify priority segments to prevent duplication or wasteful construction.
Key Consideration 8.2
Adopting disaster-resilient designs in road or water projects protects investments in flood- or typhoon-prone areas, ensuring that improvements remain functional after extreme weather events. Early consultation with local officials helps map hazards and gather indigenous knowledge about seasonal patterns.
Key Consideration 8.3
Involving local labor or subcontractors fosters community ownership, lowers labor costs, and preserves local skills. Villagers who contribute sweat equity tend to maintain the roads or water lines more diligently, reducing long-term maintenance costs for implementing agencies.
Key Consideration 8.4
Introducing solar or micro-hydropower solutions in areas lacking main grid connections provides reliable electricity and addresses concerns about high costs or inconsistent utility coverage. Partnerships with energy-focused organizations might yield technical training for local operators.
Key Consideration 8.5
Coordinating with relevant national agencies secures supplementary funding or technical guidance. In mountainous or island settings, adapting national standards for local conditions prevents design flaws and ensures compliance with safety codes.
Upgraded infrastructure not only lowers travel expenses and expands business opportunities but also strengthens community morale. If health workers, teachers, or small entrepreneurs find it easier to reach OBC barangays, social services and livelihood programs naturally follow, fulfilling the broader aims of BARMM in inclusive growth.

Policy Recommendation 9. Increased Participation of OBCs in Governance and Development Planning
OBC leaders regularly voiced concern about exclusion from the planning and decision-making processes within the Bangsamoro Government. Bringing them into governance discussions addresses key grievances that hamper collaboration and buy-in. When local voices from OBC areas feed into municipal or regional planning, projects align more closely with actual community needs. This approach acknowledges the right of OBCs to help shape policies that affect their daily lives.
Key Consideration 9.1
Institutionalizing regular consultation forums—annual or biannual—where OBC representatives meet with BARMM and LGU officials, fosters two-way communication on budget priorities and policy directions. A stable schedule ensures that feedback is systematically heard, not simply gathered once or sporadically.
Key Consideration 9.2
Ensuring that OBC representatives hold clear roles in local or regional development platforms guards against token inclusion. Providing them with voting or decision-making authority in these bodies allows them to advocate for community-driven initiatives.
Key Consideration 9.3
Simplifying governance concepts for local leaders and community members helps them engage more confidently. Short training on budgeting cycles, project proposal writing, and procurement basics clarifies how to pitch or evaluate potential interventions.
Key Consideration 9.4
Rotating meeting venues into OBC-dominated barangays offers symbolic and practical value. Leaders from the Bangsamoro ministries witness firsthand the environment and day-to-day struggles faced by residents. Meanwhile, local populations see that government agencies prioritize their area.
Key Consideration 9.5
Ensuring that youth, women, and religious leaders all take part in these governance platforms promotes diversity in ideas and perspectives. OBC communities have varied structures, and open inclusion broadens the vantage point for policy development.
Key Consideration 9.6
Monitoring and documenting outcomes from each session demonstrates that participant insights shape real policy shifts. Summaries of meetings can be circulated, fostering transparency and accountability toward community expectations.
Meaningful participation in governance reassures OBCs they remain integral components of the Bangsamoro identity, even if they live beyond the region’s territory. They see their input reflected in tangible actions—such as improved roads, livelihood grants, or cultural programs—resulting in a healthier rapport between grassroots communities and BARMM institutions.

Policy Recommendation 10. Institutional Partnerships and Coordination Mechanisms for OBC Development
Communities outside BARMM often experience fragmented support, with national agencies, local government units, and Bangsamoro ministries working in silos. Setting up or refining coordination mechanisms clarifies roles, avoids overlap, and ensures that OBCs in places like Zamboanga Peninsula, Davao, General Santos, or Palawan receive coherent and sustained assistance. This policy addresses frequent complaints regarding the labyrinth of offices that sometimes operate disconnectedly, prolonging response times or duplicating efforts.
Key Consideration 10.1
Formalizing multi-stakeholder platforms dedicated to OBC concerns, including the OOBC, BMOAs, local executives, and national line agencies, fosters consistent contact and planning. These committees meet periodically to align objectives, discuss resource-sharing, and review ongoing projects.
Key Consideration 10.2
Designating a single coordination portal or shared database for OBC-related programs helps agencies track which barangays have received which form of aid or assistance. Streamlined data prevents inadvertently ignoring certain communities or sending repeated interventions to the same area.
Key Consideration 10.3
Signing memoranda of agreement (MOA) between BMOAs and LGUs in OBC-rich localities clarifies funding, operational roles, and timelines. This ensures mutual accountability when implementing microfinance, scholarships, or infrastructural improvements.
Key Consideration 10.4
Inviting civil society organizations (CSOs) and development partners into planning sessions deepens technical expertise and can yield additional funding avenues. CSOs sometimes serve as implementers or conduits for specialized services.
Key Consideration 10.5
Establishing linkages for conflict resolution or dispute mediation ensures that political or other tensions do not derail ongoing initiatives. If land disagreements arise around project sites, a recognized conflict-handling protocol reassures all parties of a fair hearing.
Key Consideration 10.6
Providing local focal persons, possibly stationed under OOBC’s structure, facilitates day-to-day communication. These personnel update committees on emergent challenges and maintain a direct line with communities, bridging any bureaucratic gap between the Bangsamoro Government and OBC leaders.
Well-orchestrated partnerships replace fragmented assistance with a streamlined, transparent approach. Residents then see that agencies of different levels—municipal, provincial, national, and BARMM—operate cohesively. In addition to saving time and resources, this synergy makes it easier for OBC members to pinpoint exactly whom to contact for various aspects of development support.
 
NEXT STEPS: UTILIZING THE POLICY PROGRAM RECOMMENDATIONS

The ten policy and program recommendations serve as a roadmap for the Bangsamoro Government and its partners to uplift Other Bangsamoro Communities (OBCs) outside the region’s formal territory. Advancing from recommendations to on-the-ground results requires a clear plan of action that integrates these proposals into existing governance structures and development initiatives. The following steps outline how the Office of the Chief Minister through the OOBC, along with key stakeholders, can carry the recommendations forward.

1.	Official Presentation and Endorsement
The OOBC will prepare a concise policy brief or presentation that packages the recommendations for adoption by relevant Bangsamoro Government bodies, notably the Office of the Chief Minister, the Bangsamoro Parliament, and the Bangsamoro Economic and Development Council (BEDC). This approach ensures formal recognition of the recommendations and solicits endorsements from national government agencies and LGUs in OBC-rich provinces.

2.	Legislative and Executive Support
Some recommendations, such as expanded scholarship grants or comprehensive social welfare packages, may require additional legislation or executive issuances (e.g., memoranda, executive orders) to unlock funding or to formalize responsibilities among ministries and local offices. The OOBC will draft preliminary policy or program frameworks, if needed, and convene working groups to refine the details. Early involvement of appropriate policy making bodies or legislative offices can fast-track the drafting of proposed measures.

3.	Inclusion in Annual Investment Plans and Program Budgets
Integrating the policy proposals into BMOAs’ strategic and annual investment plans as well as program budgets is critical for sustainability. The OOBC, in collaboration with OBC leaders and partners, may submit proposals and resource requirements to BMOAs. Once included in official budgets, these measures gain legitimacy and secure necessary funding.

4.	Local Stakeholder Engagement and Pilot Implementation
Many recommendations call for close coordination with LGUs and community leaders. The OOBC will identify a short list of pilot OBC areas where local officials and leaders have already demonstrated interest. Implementing policy interventions on a smaller scale helps refine processes and tools. Lessons from successful pilot areas will guide broader rollout in other OBC localities.
 

5.	Multi-Stakeholder Coordination
Mechanisms such as memoranda of agreement (MOA) or intergovernmental or interagency bodies will be formalized with BMOAs, national agencies, and LGUs. Regular coordination meetings will track the progress of scholarship expansions, Madrasah subsidies, Halal enterprise projects, social service extensions, cultural programs, and other interventions. This ensures that agencies share updated information, quickly resolve implementation issues, and maintain consistency in approach.

6.	Resource Mobilization and Partnerships
The next phase entails dedicated efforts to mobilize resources beyond internal BARMM budgets. The OOBC and relevant ministries may collaborate with philanthropic foundations, bilateral agencies, and private-sector partners to fund key components such as subsidies, microfinance for women cooperatives, or community-driven tourism initiatives. Public-private partnerships can complement the primary sources of government finance and help scale up interventions more rapidly.

7.	Monitoring, Evaluation, and Adjustment
A structured monitoring and evaluation framework will be established to measure the effectiveness of each recommendation. This includes tracking enrollment rates for scholarship beneficiaries, verifying the number of operational Madaris receiving subsidies, gauging the performance of Halal enterprises, and assessing the reach of expanded social services. Feedback loops allow the OOBC and implementers to revise strategies—adding support for areas that lag, discontinuing ineffective methods, or refining eligibility criteria. Transparency and public reporting of these findings foster trust and accountability.

8.	Community Outreach and Communication
Sustaining momentum for policy actions requires continuous engagement with local leaders, youth groups, religious councils, and women’s associations. The OOBC will develop communication materials—like FAQs, posters, or short video segments—to explain the new programs, eligibility requirements, and channels for obtaining assistance. Barriers such as literacy or internet constraints will be considered in designing outreach methods, thus helping ensure communities in even the most remote areas remain well-informed.

9.	Scaling Up and Institutionalizing Reforms
As pilot successes confirm the viability of certain policy and program measures, the OOBC will expand these to more barangays and municipalities. Such scaling includes standardizing the guidelines for scholarship applications or Halal development procedures, digitizing beneficiary tracking systems, and retaining a stable budget for bridging roads or water systems over multiple fiscal years. Embedding these policy and program reforms into official plans and sectoral master plans as well as legislative measures guarantees continuity across changes in leadership or evolving budget priorities.

Following these steps deepens the integration of the policy and program recommendations into day-to-day governance and development measures. Each responds to the documented needs of Other Bangsamoro Communities, from improved learning opportunities and inclusive economic growth, to stronger social services, cultural safeguarding, and reliable infrastructure. The holistic implementation of these policies and programs will illustrate the Bangsamoro Government’s commitment to ensuring all Bangsamoro people share in the region’s aspirations for peace, prosperity, and self-determination, regardless of territorial lines.
