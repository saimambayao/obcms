**Document Version:** 2.0
**Date:** October 5, 2025
**Status:** Strategic Plan
**Authority:** Based on Unified PM Research + Architectural Assessment
**Scope:** Transform WorkItem from tactical system to enterprise PPM platform

---

## Executive Summary

### Purpose

This roadmap transforms OBCMS WorkItem from a **tactical task management system** (current 65/100 alignment) into an **enterprise-grade Portfolio-Program-Project Management (PPM) platform** (target 93/100 alignment) suitable for BARMM-wide digital transformation governance.

### Current State (OBCMS v2.0)

**WorkItem System Status:**
- ✅ 36 work items operational (projects, activities, tasks)
- ✅ MPTT hierarchical structure (6 work types, unlimited depth)
- ✅ Calendar integration with FullCalendar
- ✅ Progress tracking with auto-calculation
- ✅ Legacy model migration complete (100% data migrated)

**Alignment Score: 65/100**
- WBS Implementation: 85% (strong hierarchical foundation)
- Portfolio Management: 40% (missing governance)
- Earned Value Management: 0% (critical gap)
- Resource Management: 30% (assignment only, no capacity)
- Philippine eGov Compliance: 70% (PeGIF aligned, DICT partial)

### Target State (OBCMS v3.0 - Enterprise PPM)

**Alignment Score: 93/100**
- Portfolio Management: 90% (full governance framework)
- Program Coordination: 85% (benefits tracking, risk management)
- Project Execution: 95% (WBS, EVM, critical path)
- Resource Optimization: 85% (capacity planning, skill matching)
- Financial Accountability: 90% (budget tracking, EVM, forecasting)
- Compliance: 95% (DICT, PeGIF, COA, Data Privacy)

### Resource Requirements

**Team Composition:**
- 3 Full-stack Django developers
- 1 Senior architect (for complex features in enterprise capabilities phase)
- 1 Project manager
- 1 QA engineer
- 1 UX designer (for dashboard design in enterprise capabilities phase)

---

## Implementation Approach

### Guiding Principles

1. **Iterative Enhancement** - Build on existing WorkItem foundation, don't rebuild
2. **Backward Compatibility** - All enhancements maintain legacy model support
3. **User-Centric Design** - Follow OBCMS UI standards, prioritize usability
4. **Compliance-First** - Embed DICT, PeGIF, COA requirements from design phase
5. **Quick Wins Priority** - Deliver high-value features early (milestone tracking, budgets)
6. **Philippine Context** - BARMM-specific needs (Ramadan scheduling, cultural sensitivity)
7. **Data Sovereignty** - On-premise deployment, no cloud vendor dependencies

### Methodology

**Hybrid Approach:** RUP structure + Agile execution

**RUP Phases:**
- **Inception:** Requirements gathering and stakeholder alignment
- **Elaboration:** Architecture design, prototypes, and risk mitigation
- **Construction:** Iterative development with continuous delivery
- **Transition:** Phased rollout (pilot → ministry-wide → BARMM-wide)

**Quality Gates:**
- Code review (100% coverage)
- Automated testing (>85% pass rate)
- Security audit (Django deployment checks)
- User acceptance testing (UAT with BICTO staff)
- Performance validation (<100ms response times)

- **Success Criteria:** Portfolio dashboard adopted by leadership
- **Full Rollout:** All ministries establish portfolios

**Phase 3 Rollout**

**PRIORITY:** MEDIUM | **COMPLEXITY:** Complex | **PREREQUISITES:** Phase 2 successful, Phase 3 features tested

- **Pilot:** Major projects - EVM tracking

### Technical Deployment

**Environment Strategy:**
- **Development:** Local developer machines (SQLite)
- **Staging:** Staging server (PostgreSQL, Redis)
- **Production:** Production server (PostgreSQL with replication, Redis cluster)

**Deployment Process:**
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL | **COMPLEXITY:** Moderate

1. Code review (100% coverage, multiple approvers)
2. Automated testing (pytest, >85% pass rate)
3. Security scan (Django deployment checks, Bandit)
4. Deploy to staging (automated via GitHub Actions)
5. UAT in staging (sufficient testing period)
6. Production deployment (off-hours, rollback plan ready)
7. Smoke tests (health checks, critical path validation)
8. Monitor logs (initial period, on-call support)

**Rollback Plan:**
**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL | **COMPLEXITY:** Simple

- Database backups before each deployment (retention policy)
- Feature flags for new functionality (instant disable)
- Blue-green deployment (zero-downtime rollback)
- Fast rollback capability

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a **comprehensive, phased approach** to transforming OBCMS WorkItem from a tactical task management system into an enterprise-grade PPM platform aligned with international best practices (WBS, RUP, PMBOK) and Philippine government standards (PeGIF, DICT, COA).

**Key Success Factors:**
1. ✅ Iterative delivery (quick wins first, complex features later)
2. ✅ Strong stakeholder engagement (BICTO leadership, ministry representatives)
3. ✅ Comprehensive training (all user levels, certification programs)
4. ✅ Compliance-first approach (embed regulatory requirements from design)
5. ✅ BARMM context awareness (Ramadan scheduling, cultural sensitivity)
6. ✅ Demonstrated value through improved outcomes

**Next Steps:**

**PRIORITY:** CRITICAL | **SEQUENCE:** Sequential execution required

1. **Present Roadmap:** Present roadmap to BICTO leadership for approval
2. **Secure Resources:** Secure resource allocation
3. **Assemble Team:** Assemble project team (developers, PM, QA)
4. **Kickoff Phase 1:** Begin Phase 1 implementation (quick wins sprint)

**Strategic Impact:**

By implementing this roadmap, OBCMS will become the **definitive PPM platform for BARMM's digital transformation**, enabling:
- Transparent portfolio governance across 116 municipalities
- Strategic alignment to BEGMP/LeAPS goals
- Resource optimization with capacity-based planning
- Budget accountability (zero COA audit findings)
- Earned value-based forecasting to prevent overruns
- World-class project management capabilities (93% feature parity with enterprise platforms)

This is not just a software upgrade—it's a **transformation of how BARMM governs its digital future**.
