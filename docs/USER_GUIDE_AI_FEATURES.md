AI-Generated Policy Recommendation

Title: "Comprehensive Livelihood Support for Coastal Fishing Communities"

Problem Statement:
Fishing communities in OOBC target areas (23 coastal barangays, 15,400 households)
face economic challenges with average monthly incomes (₱8,500) below the regional
poverty threshold. MANA assessments confirm livelihood support as the top priority
(mentioned by 81% of participants), while existing community solidarity (bayanihan
tradition) and fishing expertise present strong foundations for cooperative-based
interventions.

Proposed Intervention:
Establish 12 fishing cooperatives across Regions IX and X, providing:
1. Capital financing for equipment and boat repairs (₱150,000/cooperative)
2. Value-added processing training (partnership with DTI)
3. Cooperative management and financial literacy
4. Market linkage facilitation
5. Shariah-compliant financing mechanisms

Expected Outcomes:
- 60% increase in household fishing income (₱8,500 → ₱13,600/month)
- 500 direct beneficiaries (fishing families)
- 12 sustainable fishing cooperatives established
- 2,000 indirect beneficiaries (community members)
- Enhanced food security in coastal communities

Cultural Considerations:
The intervention builds on existing bayanihan traditions and Islamic values of
mutual support (ta'awun). Shariah-compliant financing ensures alignment with
religious principles, while cooperative structure respects traditional community
decision-making led by datu and imam leadership.

Budget Estimate: ₱18.5M over 24 months
Success Metrics: Income increase (60%), cooperative sustainability (80%),
member satisfaction (90%)

AI Confidence: 89% (based on similar successful interventions)
