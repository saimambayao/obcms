# Work Items Profile Page - Quick Fix Summary

**Issue**: Work items show in calendar but not in "Assigned tasks" section

---

## The Problem in 3 Points

1. **Calendar**: Shows ALL work items (projects, activities, tasks) ✅ CORRECT
2. **Assigned Tasks Section**: Shows ONLY tasks ❌ TOO RESTRICTIVE
3. **Status Distribution**: Counts ONLY tasks ❌ INCOMPLETE DATA

---

## The Root Cause

**File**: `src/common/views/management.py`

```python
# LINE 267-270: TOO RESTRICTIVE
recent_tasks = (
    WorkItem.objects.filter(work_type="task", assignees=profile.user)  # ❌ Only tasks
    .prefetch_related("teams", "assignees")
    .order_by("-updated_at")[:10]
)

# LINE 276-281: TOO RESTRICTIVE
tasks_by_status = {
    label: profile.user.assigned_work_items.filter(
        work_type="task", status=status  # ❌ Only tasks
    ).count()
    for status, label in WorkItem.STATUS_CHOICES
}
```

---

## The Fix (2 Simple Changes)

### Change 1: Recent Work Items Query

```python
# Remove work_type filter to include all work types
recent_tasks = (
    WorkItem.objects.filter(assignees=profile.user)  # ✅ All work types
    .prefetch_related("teams", "assignees")
    .order_by("-updated_at")[:10]
)
```

### Change 2: Status Distribution Query

```python
# Remove work_type filter from status count
tasks_by_status = {
    label: profile.user.assigned_work_items.filter(
        status=status  # ✅ All work types
    ).count()
    for status, label in WorkItem.STATUS_CHOICES
}
```

---

## Testing the Fix

### Before Fix
```
Assigned tasks: "No tasks assigned to this staff member yet."
Status distribution: All zeros
Calendar: Shows "Draeganess" project ← DATA MISMATCH
```

### After Fix
```
Assigned tasks: Shows "Draeganess" and other work items ✅
Status distribution: Shows accurate counts ✅
Calendar: Shows "Draeganess" project ✅
```

---

## Why This Works

The `WorkItem` model supports 6 work types:
- Project
- Sub-Project
- Activity
- Sub-Activity
- **Task** ← Original query only showed this
- Subtask

All work types share the same fields (assignees, status, dates), so there's no technical reason to filter by `work_type="task"`.

**Result**: Removing the filter shows a complete picture of the user's workload.

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Modify `src/common/views/management.py` lines 267-270
- [ ] Modify `src/common/views/management.py` lines 276-281
- [ ] Restart Django server
- [ ] Test: Navigate to `/profile/?tab=tasks`
- [ ] Verify: "Assigned tasks" shows all work types
- [ ] Verify: Status distribution shows correct counts
- [ ] Verify: Calendar still works correctly

**No database migration needed** - pure query modification.
