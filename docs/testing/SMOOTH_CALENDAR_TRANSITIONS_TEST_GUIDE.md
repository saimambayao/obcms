## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Event disappears instantly (no fade)

**Possible Causes:**
1. `window.calendar` not defined
2. Event ID mismatch (`work-item-${workItemId}`)
3. CSS transitions not applied

**Fix:**
1. Check console: `window.calendar` should be defined
2. Verify event ID format in calendar
3. Check CSS transitions in browser DevTools

---

### Issue: Calendar still flickers

**Possible Causes:**
1. Old JavaScript cached
2. CSS transitions not loaded
3. Calendar container missing styles

**Fix:**
1. Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Verify CSS in DevTools → Elements → Styles

---

### Issue: Rollback not working on error

**Possible Causes:**
1. Error handler not triggered
2. `window.calendar.refetchEvents()` failing

**Fix:**
1. Check console for error handler logs
2. Verify calendar instance exists
3. Test network error explicitly (DevTools Offline mode)

---

## Success Criteria Summary

**PASS if:**
- ✅ Delete: Event fades out smoothly (no flash)
- ✅ Duplicate: Calendar updates smoothly
- ✅ Save: Calendar updates smoothly
- ✅ No jarring flicker anywhere
- ✅ Success toasts appear
- ✅ Error rollback works

**FAIL if:**
- ❌ Any operation causes calendar flicker/flash
- ❌ Event disappears instantly (no fade)
- ❌ Full page reload occurs
- ❌ JavaScript errors in console
- ❌ Animations stutter or lag

## Quick Visual Test (30 seconds)

**The "Feel Test":**
1. Delete 3 events in a row
2. Ask yourself: "Did that feel smooth and polished?"

**Expected Answer:** "Yes! That felt like Google Calendar!"
