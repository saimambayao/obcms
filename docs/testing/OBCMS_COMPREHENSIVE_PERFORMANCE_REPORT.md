## 3. Calendar System Performance

### 3.1 Calendar Payload Generation

| Cache State | Time (ms) | Queries | Memory (MB) | Status |
|-------------|-----------|---------|-------------|--------|
| Cold cache | **133.36** | 14 | 3.86 | ✅ PASS |
| Warm cache | **1.63** | 0 | 0.14 | ✅ EXCELLENT |

**Performance Characteristics:**
- **Cold cache:** 133ms with 14 queries (fetching all module events)
- **Warm cache:** 1.63ms with **0 queries** (100% cache hit)
- **Cache effectiveness:** **82x faster** when cached
- **Memory efficiency:** 3.86MB peak (cold), 0.14MB (warm)

**Breakdown (Cold Cache - 14 Queries):**
1. Session/authentication queries: 2-3
2. Module event queries (coordination, communities, MANA, etc.): 8-10
3. Metadata and conflict detection: 2-3

**Verdict:** ✅ **GOOD** - Caching strategy highly effective, cold performance acceptable

## 4. OBC Community Operations

### 4.1 Municipality Coverage Sync

| Operation | Dataset | Time (ms) | Queries | Status |
|-----------|---------|-----------|---------|--------|
| refresh_from_communities | 10 communities | **15.31** | 15 | ⚠️ PASS |

**Analysis:**
- **15 queries for 10 communities** suggests 1-2 queries per community
- Potential **N+1 pattern** in aggregation
- Performance acceptable (**15.31ms**) but could be optimized to 3-5 queries

**Recommendation:**
- Use **aggregate()** with all fields in single query
- Potential optimization: Reduce from 15 → 5 queries

**Verdict:** ⚠️ **ACCEPTABLE** - Room for optimization but not critical

---

## 5. Database Structure Analysis

### 5.1 Index Coverage ✅ COMPREHENSIVE

**WorkItem Table Indexes:** 22 indexes configured
- `parent_id` - Tree traversal (MPTT)
- `created_by_id` - User relationships
- `priority` - Sorting and filtering
- `recurrence_pattern_id` - Recurring tasks
- Additional MPTT fields (lft, rght, tree_id, level)

**Database Statistics:**
- Total Barangays: **6,612** (comprehensive geographic coverage)
- WorkItems: **0** (test database)

**Verdict:** ✅ **WELL-INDEXED** - Comprehensive index coverage for performance
