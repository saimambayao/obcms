## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Start (Testing)

```bash
cd /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/obcms

# 1. Ensure scripts are executable (already done)
ls -lh scripts/backup-*.sh

# 2. Test database backup
./scripts/backup-database.sh daily

# 3. Test media backup
./scripts/backup-media.sh daily

# 4. Test complete backup
./scripts/backup-all.sh daily

LATEST_BACKUP=$(ls -t backups/daily/*.sql.gz | head -1)
./scripts/verify-backup.sh "$LATEST_BACKUP"

# 6. Check monitoring
./scripts/backup-monitor.sh --status
```

### Production Deployment

```bash
# 1. Edit crontab configuration
nano scripts/backup-crontab.txt
# Replace /path/to/obcms with: /Users/saidamenmambayao/apps/obcms

# 2. Install crontab
