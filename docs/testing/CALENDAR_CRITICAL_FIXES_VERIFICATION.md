## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Calendar Doesn't Expand
**Symptom:** Sidebar closes but calendar stays compressed

**Check:**
```javascript
window.debugCalendar()
// Look at calendarContainer class
```

**Expected:** `calendarContainer: "calendar-container"`
**Problem:** `calendarContainer: "calendar-container detail-open"`

**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `closeDetailPanel()` is being called
- Check CSS transitions are enabled

### Issue: Deleted Event Still Visible
**Symptom:** Event doesn't disappear after deletion

**Check Network Tab:**
- Is new request being made?
- Is cache-buster parameter present?
- Is response returning correct data?

**Check Console:**
- Do you see "Refetching calendar events..."?
- Is event count decreasing?

**Solution:**
- Hard refresh browser (`Ctrl+Shift+R` or `Cmd+Shift+R`)
- Clear browser cache
- Verify DELETE request returns 204 status

### Issue: No Console Logs
**Symptom:** Console is silent

**Check:**
- Console filter level (should be "All" not "Errors only")
- Console is cleared (`console.clear()`)

**Solution:**
```javascript
window.debugCalendar()
// This should always work if calendar is initialized
```
