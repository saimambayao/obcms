**Suite:** `tests/frontend/test_frontend_ui_components.py`

**Status:** ✅ 16 passed · ⚠️ 2 expected xfails (modules without UI templates)

## Module Coverage

### communities | PRIORITY: CRITICAL | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- Filters in `src/templates/communities/provincial_manage.html` use HTMX targets, swap transitions, and indicators to keep directory listings reactive.
- Results partial (`src/templates/communities/partials/provincial_manage_results.html`) renders via `components/data_table_card.html`, preserving list/card layout consistency.

### coordination | PRIORITY: CRITICAL | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- Resource booking form (`src/templates/coordination/resource_booking_form.html`) triggers conflict detection through HTMX change events and shared loading targets.
- Event attendance tracker (`src/templates/coordination/event_attendance_tracker.html`) polls live counters and participant list every 10s with HTMX swaps and loading states.

### mana | PRIORITY: HIGH | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- AI detail pane (`src/templates/mana/mana_assessment_detail_ai.html`) wires multiple async insight panels with `hx-get`/`hx-swap` patterns.
- Assessment edit workflow (`src/templates/mana/mana_assessment_edit.html`) composes inputs via shared `components/form_field*.html` partials to enforce 48px fields and emerald focus styling.

### policies | PRIORITY: HIGH | COMPLEXITY: Moderate
- Policy creation page (`src/templates/recommendations/recommendations_new.html`) keeps gradient hero, rounded-xl inputs, and SMART guidance text aligned with standards.

### recommendations | PRIORITY: HIGH | COMPLEXITY: Moderate
- Recommendations home (`src/templates/recommendations/recommendations_home.html`) streams dashboard cards through HTMX `load, every 60s` polling with swap animations.

### policy_tracking | PRIORITY: HIGH | COMPLEXITY: Moderate
- Evidence dashboard widget (`src/templates/recommendations/policy_tracking/widgets/evidence_dashboard.html`) validates semantic badges and collapsible detail states.
- Impact simulation widget (`src/templates/recommendations/policy_tracking/widgets/impact_simulation.html`) enforces scenario tabs, gradient metric tiles, and progress bars.

### documents | PRIORITY: HIGH | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- ⚠️ No dedicated frontend templates detected. Test marked xfail to flag the gap; implement document library UI before enabling coverage.

### project_central | PRIORITY: CRITICAL | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- Portfolio dashboard (`src/templates/project_central/portfolio_dashboard.html`) confirms stat cards, gradient hero, and CTA buttons follow PPA design language.
- AI insights section (`src/templates/project_central/ai_insights_section.html`) ensures anomaly, forecast, risk, and optimization panels hydrate via HTMX.

### recommendations › ai_assistant | PRIORITY: MEDIUM | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- Chat widget (`src/templates/components/ai_chat_widget.html`) validates HTMX submission hooks, optimistic UI handlers, and `aria-live` announcements.

### monitoring | PRIORITY: CRITICAL | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- PPA row partial (`src/templates/monitoring/partials/_ppa_work_item_row.html`) confirms expand/collapse HTMX triggers, semantic status badges, and sidebar targets.

### common | PRIORITY: CRITICAL | COMPLEXITY: Moderate
- Main dashboard (`src/templates/common/dashboard.html`) auto-refreshes stat cards via HTMX and preserves fallback markup for no-JS scenarios.

### data_imports | PRIORITY: MEDIUM | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- ⚠️ No user-facing templates discovered. Test marked xfail; build importer dashboards/forms to close coverage.

### common dashboards & analytics | PRIORITY: HIGH | COMPLEXITY: Complex
- Analytics dashboard (`src/templates/common/analytics_dashboard.html`) keeps gradient forecast banner, stat cards, and sector performance stacks aligned with UI guide.

## Next Steps
1. Build document management UI templates and update tests to remove the xfail.
2. Scaffold dedicated data import dashboards/forms, then assert HTMX progress indicators and result summaries.
3. Extend the suite with Playwright smoke flows once staging data fixtures are stable.
