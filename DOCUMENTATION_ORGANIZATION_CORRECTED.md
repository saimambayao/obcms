# Documentation Organization - Correction Applied ✅

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Issue:** AI configuration files incorrectly moved to docs/
**Resolution:** Moved back to project root
**Status:** ✅ Corrected and verified

## What Happened

During documentation organization, **CLAUDE.md, GEMINI.md, and AGENTS.md** were initially moved to `docs/development/`. This was a mistake because these are **configuration files**, not documentation.

## Why It Was Wrong

AI coding agents (Claude Code, Gemini, etc.) read these files from the **project root** to understand how to work with the project:

- **CLAUDE.md** - Tells Claude Code about project-specific conventions, tools, and standards
- **GEMINI.md** - Configures Google Gemini integration
- **AGENTS.md** - Overview of AI agent configurations

Moving them to `docs/development/` would break AI functionality because agents wouldn't find them.

## Correction Applied

✅ **Moved back to project root:**
```bash
mv docs/development/CLAUDE.md .
mv docs/development/GEMINI.md .
mv docs/development/AGENTS.md .
```

✅ **Updated documentation references:**
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) - Links now point to `../CLAUDE.md` (root)
- [docs/development/README.md](docs/development/README.md) - Explains config files are in root

## Lesson Learned

**Configuration files vs Documentation:**
- **Configuration files** = Read by tools/agents → Stay in project root
- **Documentation files** = Read by humans → Organize under docs/

Examples:
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` in root (config) → Referenced from docs/
- ✅ `docs/development/README.md` (documentation) → In docs/

## Final Status

### Files in Project Root
```
├── README.md                    # Project overview
├── CLAUDE.md ⚙️                # Claude configuration
├── GEMINI.md ⚙️                # Gemini configuration
└── AGENTS.md ⚙️                # AI agents overview
```

### Documentation in docs/
```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Documentation index
├── development/
│   └── README.md               # References root config files
├── testing/                    # Testing docs
├── deployment/                 # Deployment docs
├── reference/                  # Technical reference
└── [other categories]
```

## Verification

✅ **Claude Code can read CLAUDE.md:**
```bash
$ cat CLAUDE.md | head -5
# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code)
when working with code in this repository.
```

✅ **Documentation links work:**
- [docs/README.md](docs/README.md) → Links to `../CLAUDE.md` ✅
- [docs/development/README.md](docs/development/README.md) → Links to `../../CLAUDE.md` ✅

✅ **Statistics:**
- Root .md files: 4 (README + 3 AI configs)
- Documentation in docs/: 66 files
- Total organized: 11 documentation files moved

**Corrected by:** Claude Code (after user feedback)
**Thank you for catching this!** 🙏

This is a good example of why:
1. Always verify functionality after moving files
2. Understand the difference between config and docs
3. AI agents need specific file locations to work properly
