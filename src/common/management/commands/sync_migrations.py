"""
Django management command to synchronize migration state with database.

This command checks if tables exist in the database but migrations are not marked
as applied. If so, it fakes the migrations to sync the state without actually
running the SQL.

This is useful when:
- Migrations were run directly on the database
- Migration files were added after tables were created
- Recovering from migration conflicts
