"""
Budget Execution Signals for Audit Logging
Compliance: Parliament Bill No. 325 Section 78

Audit logging is handled by:
1. AuditMiddleware (common.middleware.AuditMiddleware) - Captures all budget changes
2. Django-auditlog - Built-in audit trail
3. These signals - Additional context-specific logging

All financial operations (allotments, obligations, disbursements) are automatically
logged by the middleware. These signals provide additional event hooks if needed.
