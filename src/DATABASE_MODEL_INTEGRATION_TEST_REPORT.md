## 6. Issues Identified

### üü° Medium Priority Issues

#### Database Migration Conflicts
**Issue:** Duplicate index conflicts during test database setup
**Impact:** Automated testing cannot run without manual intervention
**Root Cause:** Migration files contain duplicate index definitions
**Recommendation:** Clean up duplicate indexes in migration files

### üü¢ Low Priority Issues

#### Test Coverage Limitations
**Issue:** Integration tests need manual verification due to setup issues
**Impact:** Cannot automatically validate model relationships
**Recommendation:** Set up separate test database with clean migrations
