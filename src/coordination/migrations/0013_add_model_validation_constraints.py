"""
Delete legacy Event models in preparation for WorkItem migration.

This migration is part of the StaffTask/Event/ProjectWorkflow â†’ WorkItem consolidation.
Event-related models are deleted here, and EventProxy is created in common.0022.

Migration Sequence:
- common.0020: Create WorkItem model
- common.0021: Delete StaffTask
- coordination.0013: Delete Event (THIS MIGRATION)
- common.0022: Create EventProxy pointing to WorkItem

Note: EventProxy created in common app after Event deleted here.
Proxies point to WorkItem, not the old Event model.
