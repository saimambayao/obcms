## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How long do I have to complete each workshop?**
A: Your facilitator sets deadlines. Typically 3-7 days per workshop. Check communication from facilitator for specific dates.

**Q: Can I edit my submission after clicking "Submit"?**
A: No. Once submitted, responses are locked. Double-check before submitting. If you need to make changes, contact your facilitator.
